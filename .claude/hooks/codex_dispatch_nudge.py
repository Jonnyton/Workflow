"""Claude Code hook: push the Codex cross-family dispatch reflex.

Claude sessions *have* the `mcp__codex__codex` capability and the CLAUDE.md
§"Calling Codex via MCP" instructions in context, but the behavior is passive
knowledge — without a trigger at the decision moment the default-to-self bias
wins and the opposite-provider gate silently doesn't fire (the failure the host
reported: Claude finishes a review and presents a verdict without ever
cross-checking with Codex, then only dispatches once told to).

This is the trigger layer. On UserPromptSubmit, classify the prompt against the
qualifying surface (review / finding / risky-ship / decision / stuck /
second-opinion) and inject an imperative reminder with the exact dispatch shape.
Mirrors provider_context_feed_hook.py: non-blocking, additionalContext only.

Calibrated aggressive per host directive 2026-06-30 (default-to-dispatch), but
deliberately NOT firing on every build/edit/lookup — a nudge on every turn is
noise that gets tuned out, which defeats the purpose. It fires where an
independent model genuinely adds confidence.
