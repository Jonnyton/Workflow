# Idea Pipeline

This file turns captured ideas into deliberate outcomes instead of leaving them
as orphaned notes.

## States

- `captured`: recorded in `ideas/INBOX.md`, not yet clarified.
- `triaged`: deduplicated, sized, and given a next home.
- `promoted`: moved into a concrete surface such as `STATUS.md`,
  `docs/design-notes/`, `docs/exec-plans/active/`, or `PLAN.md`.
- `landed`: implemented and recorded in `ideas/SHIPPED.md`.
- `dropped`: intentionally declined or deferred with a reason.
- `reframed-community-build`: feature was approved as a concept but declined as a platform primitive per `project_community_build_over_platform_build` / `project_minimal_primitives_principle`; intent lives on as a community-build pattern (wiki rubric, chatbot composition, remixable node template) rather than platform code. Capture the composition path so the user-facing intent isn't lost.

## Promotion Paths

| Idea Shape | Next Home | Why |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| Small, ready, clearly bounded | `STATUS.md` `Work` | It is actionable now. |
| New truth, risk, or contradiction | `STATUS.md` `Concerns` | It changes what is currently true. |
| Needs reasoning or tradeoff analysis | `docs/design-notes/` | It needs durable thinking before build work. |
| Changes design truth | `PLAN.md` after user approval | The architecture or principles change. |
| Multi-step delivery with checkpoints | `docs/exec-plans/active/` | It is too large for one board row. |
| Already landed | `ideas/SHIPPED.md` | Keep the idea-to-shipping trail. |

## Session Triage Rule

1. Scan the oldest untriaged inbox items.
2. Merge duplicates and add links.
3. Promote at least one real item when the inbox is non-empty.
4. If nothing should move yet, record the blocker instead of leaving silence.

## Active Promotions

| Idea | State | Next Home | Owner | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|-------|
| ChatGPT Apps as first-class host + live-state surface | promoted | `docs/exec-plans/active/2026-05-01-host-discoverability-and-onboarding-rollout.md`; future design note should still check Apps SDK/MCP Apps compatibility against `PLAN.md` API/MCP Interface, Live State Shape, Distribution + Discoverability, and full-platform architecture sections 15/17/20/26/28/29. | navigator + codex-gpt5-desktop | Promoted 2026-05-01 into the host discoverability/onboarding rollout. Treat Apps SDK as a chatbot host/UI wrapper over the same daemon + durable-state contract, not a replacement architecture. |
| Runtime fiction memory graph | promoted | `docs/design-notes/2026-04-09-runtime-fiction-memory-graph.md`, `docs/exec-plans/active/2026-04-09-runtime-fiction-memory-graph.md`, `docs/design-notes/2026-04-09-memory-graph-research-brief.md`, `docs/exec-plans/active/2026-04-27-runtime-fiction-memory-graph-restart-cards.md`, `docs/specs/2026-04-27-runtime-memory-graph-minimal-schema-v1.md`, `docs/notes/2026-04-27-runtime-memory-graph-contradiction-policy.md` | future session | Turn worldbuilding/docs output into typed world truth, event, epistemic, and narrative-debt memory with scene packets and generated indexes. Research brief added 2026-04-09 with frontier validation (DOME, SCORE, StoryWriter, A-Mem, LightRAG, MemOS) and concrete gap analysis. Restart cards + v1 schema + contradiction policy added 2026-04-27 to reduce cold-start and ambiguity for implementation. |
| Methods-prose evaluator (Priya signal #2 / Proposal C) | reframed-community-build | `docs/design-notes/2026-04-27-methods-prose-evaluator.md` + `docs/notes/2026-04-27-methods-prose-rubric-starter-pack.md` (composition doctrine + publish-ready rubric content) | navigator + codex-gpt5-desktop | **REFRAMED 2026-04-26 per host directive** (memory: `project_community_build_over_platform_build`): platform will NOT ship methods-prose evaluator as a primitive. Chatbot composes from existing evaluator surface + wiki rubrics. Header/body reframe is reflected and starter rubric content now exists for wiki publication. No `EvaluatorKind` extension. INBOX provenance: 2026-04-27 entry. |
| Recency primitives — retired `extensions action=my_recent_runs` + `goals action=my_recent` (Priya signal #1) | retired-community-composition | `docs/specs/2026-04-27-recency-and-continue-branch-primitives.md` records supersession; future wiki/page can document query-run composition if users need examples. | none | F2 accepted 2026-04-28 and freshness-checked 2026-05-01: Recency is not a platform primitive. Use existing query-run + optional goal/branch lookup composition. |
| Continue-run resume primitive — `extensions action=run_branch resume_from=...` (Priya signal #6 + Devin Session 2 + 2026-04-24 extend-run dup) | dev-ready after #18 | `docs/specs/2026-04-27-recency-and-continue-branch-primitives.md` + `docs/specs/2026-04-27-recency-continue-fixture-pack.md` + `docs/exec-plans/active/2026-04-27-post-18-recency-continue-implementation-cards.md` | dev post-#18 | F2 accepted 2026-04-28 and freshness-checked 2026-05-01: no standalone `continue_branch` verb; add only `resume_from=<run_id>` to existing `run_branch`. |
| Cross-algorithm methodological-parity guidance — `node action=compatibility_with` or wiki concept page (Priya signal #4) | promoted | `docs/design-notes/2026-04-27-cross-algorithm-methodological-parity-guidance.md` + `docs/notes/2026-04-27-cross-algorithm-parity-wiki-template.md` + `docs/notes/2026-04-27-cross-algorithm-parity-publication-checklist.md` | codex-gpt5-desktop | INBOX provenance: 2026-04-27 (cross-algorithm-parity). Promoted 2026-04-27: design decision landed; publish template + publication checklist + RF-vs-MaxEnt seed are ready for wiki publication and user-sim validation. |
| Trust-graduation observability — "% users skipping dry-inspect on session N" (Priya signal #7) | promoted | `docs/design-notes/2026-04-27-trust-graduation-observability-metric.md` + `docs/notes/2026-04-27-trust-graduation-query-pack.md` (metric contract + query/dashboard pack implementation-ready). | codex-gpt5-desktop | INBOX provenance: 2026-04-27 (trust-graduation). Promoted 2026-04-27 as docs-ready instrumentation slice; query examples and dashboard sketch now land with the metric contract. |
| CONTRIBUTORS.md authoring surface (Co-Authored-By attribution) | promoted | `docs/design-notes/2026-04-27-contributors-authoring-surface.md` + `docs/notes/2026-04-27-contributors-maintenance-runbook.md` (decision + maintenance/merge hygiene runbook). | codex-gpt5-desktop | INBOX provenance: 2026-04-25. Anchored in `AGENTS.md` Hard Rule #10 (read CONTRIBUTORS.md → emit Co-Authored-By). Promotion landed 2026-04-27 with decision, escalation criteria, and maintenance rules. |
| `hyperparameter_importance` evaluator node (Priya W&B signal #4) | promoted | `docs/catalogs/scientific-computing-domain-catalog.md` + `docs/specs/2026-04-27-hyperparameter-importance-evaluator-node.md` + `docs/specs/2026-04-27-hyperparameter-importance-fixture-pack.md` + `docs/exec-plans/active/2026-04-27-hyperparameter-importance-implementation-cards.md` | codex-gpt5-desktop | INBOX provenance: 2026-04-24 (Priya-W&B-trial). Domain-specific (scientific-computing skill, NOT engine). Contract + fixtures + implementation cards are now prebuilt for immediate lane-open execution; SCI-EVAL-001 parks it in the science-domain catalog. |
| Agent-teams-on-Workflow (open-source-Claude-Code-analog as a user project) | promoted | `docs/notes/2026-04-20-agent-teams-on-workflow-research.md` + `docs/notes/2026-04-27-agent-teams-post-uptime-scoping-checklist.md` (post-unblock checklist now execution-ready). | codex-gpt5-desktop + navigator-followup | INBOX provenance: 2026-04-20 (host-source). Research note maps 11-seam gaps + viral-moment considerations + foundation/UX/commons rankings; recommends nano-claude-code as Python reference base. Promoted 2026-04-27 by adding a concrete entry-gates + phase checklist artifact so work starts immediately when unblock criteria are met. |

## Backlog Burn-Down Queue (2026-04-28)

Ordered for fastest de-risking while #18/#23 remain in flight. Before moving
any row to `STATUS.md`, run
`python scripts/claim_check.py --provider <name> --check-files "<Files>"`.

| Priority | Claim-ready slice | Files boundary | Depends / blocker | Suggested owner | Exit check |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Agent-teams-on-Workflow scoping exercise. Treat as user project validation of platform primitives, not a platform build item. | `docs/notes/2026-04-20-agent-teams-on-workflow-research.md`, future scoping note | Blocked on uptime-track close + daemon-economy first draft. | navigator-followup | Scoping note maps required user-project primitives to existing roadmap without inventing a new platform track. |

## Archive

- [2026-05-01] F2 recency/continue backlog rows retired. Recency actions are superseded by existing query-run composition; continuation is the dev-ready `run_branch resume_from=<run_id>` row in `STATUS.md`.
- [2026-05-01] Burn-down rows 1, 2, 3, and 6 retired after freshness check: methods-prose reframe, cross-algorithm parity template, CONTRIBUTORS file-first decision, and trust metric/query pack already exist under their 2026-04-27 artifact names.
- [2026-05-01] `hyperparameter_importance` burn-down row retired: `docs/catalogs/scientific-computing-domain-catalog.md` now has SCI-EVAL-001 and keeps v1 out of engine scope.
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Workflow seed-style retrofit initialized.
# 2026-04-09

- Research pipeline item: translate BettaFish's strongest pattern set into Workflow-native architecture.
- Source document: `docs/bettafish-refactor-research-2026-04-09.md`.
- Target outcome: narrative IR, staged drafting, typed deliberation bus, durable run ledger, and hard validation gates without adopting BettaFish's log-scraping transport, framework sprawl, or GPL-covered code.
