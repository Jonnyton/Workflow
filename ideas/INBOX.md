# Idea Inbox

Quick capture surface for loose ideas, user nudges, possible features, and
half-formed experiments.

## Rules

- Capture first, refine later.
- Keep one idea per entry.
- If an idea becomes work, a design note, or a plan, add the destination in
  `Links` instead of deleting the capture history.
- Merge duplicates during triage in `ideas/PIPELINE.md`, not during capture.

## Inbox

- [2026-05-02] (source: host, owner: unassigned, status: capture, priority: uptime-loop, size: small) **Review open-source Python Claude Code / Claude Code agent-team implementation for persistence lessons.** User flagged an external repo as possible inspiration. Evaluate it later against Workflow's target advantages: 24/7 persistence without humans online, truthful daemon identity, connector-driven public loop, and multi-provider durable coordination. Need repo URL/name before research.

- [2026-05-02] (source: host, owner: unassigned, status: promoted, priority: post-#18, size: medium) **Daemon mini OpenBrain per soul-bearing daemon.** Research Nate B. Jones / Open Brain and adapt the pattern so each daemon controls an atomic, searchable memory backend that works with its existing daemon wiki. Direction captured in `docs/design-notes/2026-05-02-daemon-mini-openbrain.md`: wiki stays the curated face; mini brain is daemon-scoped capture/search/review/promote storage; observable memory traces query/retrieve/inject/write/promote/compact; no one flat pool, no soul copying, no Supabase/OpenRouter dependency by default.
- [2026-05-01] (source: host, owner: unassigned, status: promoted, priority: uptime-loop, size: medium) **Patch-request incentives + requester-directed daemon work.** Users may attach optional incentives to patch/feature requests to make independent daemons more likely to pick them up earlier than other queued requests, but incentives must not influence whether a patch is accepted, released, or merged. Users may also direct their own daemons to work on a specific patch request to speed up their own iteration. This can produce faster proposals/evidence, not a landing guarantee. Promoted immediately to `PLAN.md` Multi-User Evolutionary Design and `STATUS.md` loop work because the live community patch loop is uptime-related.

- [2026-04-27] (source: navigator-userim-review, owner: none, status: retired-community-composition, priority: post-uptime, size: medium) **`extensions action=my_recent_runs` + `goals action=my_recent` — user-scoped recency primitives.** Priya Session 2 (2026-04-20) signal #1: chatbot needs one tool call to answer "show me what I built recently" instead of fishing through `list_branches` + `query_runs` with author filter. Workspace-memory continuity gap — distinct from chatbot_assumes_workflow first-chat principle (this is N-th chat continuity).
  Resolution 2026-05-01: retired as platform primitives after freshness check. Use existing query-run plus optional goal/branch lookup composition; do not dispatch `_action_my_recent_*` code work.

"Extend the sweep" / "continue branch" has no clean Workflow path — chatbot has to semantically infer "clone this branch, add nodes, re-run with extended inputs." Same root concern as INBOX 2026-04-24 entry but with concrete API shape proposal.
  Files (when scoped): `workflow/api/runs.py` (add `resume_from=<run_id>` to existing `run_branch`); tests.
  Depends: #18 lock clears.
  Verification: persona replay plus live MCP `run_branch` call with `resume_from` proves chatbot routes to the existing run surface instead of re-scaffolding.

- [2026-04-27] (source: navigator-userim-review, owner: navigator, status: reframed-community-build, priority: domain-skill, size: medium) **Methods-prose evaluator class — publication-grade methods correctness.** Priya signal #2: when chatbot generates publication-grade methods paragraph (library versions + CV description + algorithm config), nothing checks correctness. Cross-layer chain-break (pitch-vs-product gap): platform pitches "Evaluator-driven workflows" but methods-section prose has no evaluator.
  Triaged 2026-04-27; refreshed 2026-04-28: host declined a new platform primitive. Next slice is a docs-only reframe of `docs/design-notes/2026-04-27-methods-prose-evaluator.md` to preserve the intent as chatbot + wiki composition guidance. No `EvaluatorKind` extension.

  **Agent-teams-on-Workflow: open-source-Claude-Code-analog as a user
  project, backed by our primitives.**
  Host framing: the Claude Code system prompt leaked; a Python open-source
  analog is growing fast on GitHub and trending toward one of the fastest-
  growing repos. Opportunity — build "Claude Code agent teams" where each
  teammate is another Workflow node invoked via a daemon-request, and the
  teammates live in another branch of the workflow. **This is a USER
  project, not ours to build.** Our job is to make sure the primitives
  exist on the platform so the user's chatbot can compose this — daemon
  requests across branches, teammate roles as nodes, inter-teammate
  messaging via the paid-market / free-queue bid layer, per-teammate
  provenance + audit.
  Why this matters: validates the "daemon economy + convergent commons"
  thesis with a concrete, viral-shaped use case that isn't fantasy-
  authoring. If the OSS Claude-Code-analog audience can compose their
  agent teams on Workflow, the platform rides that wave.
  Required primitives (load-bearing, to check against existing roadmap):
  (a) node → daemon-request invocation with typed inputs/outputs,
  (b) cross-branch teammate spawning without per-teammate auth friction,
  (c) teammate identity + soul-file attachment per `project_terminology_daemon`,
  (d) per-teammate provenance in the activity log, (e) inter-teammate
  messaging — bid market OR free-queue fan-out, probably both,
  (f) graceful partial-failure when one teammate's daemon is down
  (handled by daemon-economy fallback paths).
  Open questions to answer at triage time (NOT now): does this need a
  dedicated MCP verb set for teammate orchestration, or does it compose
  from existing `submit_request` + branch primitives? Is the OSS Claude-
  Code-analog's data model mappable to our node-type taxonomy without
  forcing a schema change? How does convergent-commons apply — should
  popular teammate definitions be wiki-shared, forkable, autoresearch-
  optimizable?
  Dependencies: uptime-track (all 14 self-host rows) lands first;
  daemon-economy first-draft (Track A + bid + settlement) lands first;
  then this becomes a scoping exercise.

  **"Extend run" / "continue branch" as a first-class primitive.**
  User-sim signal: Priya Session 2 ask "add BIOCLIM + RF for comparison on the same 14 species"
  has no clean Workflow verb. "New branch" implies fresh scaffolding. "New run" implies same
  algo-set. Chatbot must semantically infer "clone this branch, add algorithm nodes, re-run
  same species set." No existing primitive surfaces this as an intent. Chain-break: Interface 1
  primitive gap — chatbot improvises where it should have a clear tool.
  Scoping questions: (a) clone-branch-and-add-nodes vs. re-run-with-additional-params vs.
  new sibling branch? (b) does this need a new MCP verb (`extend_branch`/`continue_run`) or
  is it composable from `submit_request` + `clone_branch`? (c) what state carries over from
  the original run (params, results, species set)?
  Dependencies: in-flight run recovery part 2 (#6) should land first (resume semantics
  inform extension semantics).

  **`hyperparameter_importance` evaluator node for scientific/ML domain.**
  W&B Sweeps computes hyperparameter importance (which knobs matter most across a sweep)
  automatically. Workflow has no equivalent. User-sim rates it "cheap to add, high-value

  not the engine. CV-as-first-class-primitive is the structural moat; this is a parity win.
