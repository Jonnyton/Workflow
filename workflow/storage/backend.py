"""Storage backend protocol for Phase 7 dual-write cutover.

Per spec (``docs/specs/phase7_github_as_catalog.md`` §Architecture):

```
StorageBackend (protocol)
├── sqlite_only      — current default; tests + transitional builds
├── sqlite_cached    — writes go YAML→git first, SQLite mirrors as read cache
└── filesystem_only  — far-future; SQLite gone
```

Phase 7.1 ships ``sqlite_only`` and ``sqlite_cached``. The git op in
``sqlite_cached`` is a no-op in this ship — it writes YAML to the
working directory and returns. Phase 7.2 bolts on ``git_bridge.py``
and the stage/commit calls land at the marked extension points.

Reads stay through SQLite for query performance in both backends.
