"""Workflow Server — Remote MCP interface.

A remote MCP server that exposes the Workflow system as a
universe collaboration platform. Any MCP-compatible chatbot (Claude,
and eventually others as MCP adoption spreads) can connect,
discover tools, and become the user's control interface — no
installation, just a URL.

Design principles:
    - A small coarse-grained tool set, with narrow read-only aliases only
      when live chatbot evidence shows hidden action verbs are not
      discoverable enough for user-critical workflows
    - Universe-aware: tools accept universe context, not a hardcoded env var
    - MCP prompts deliver behavioral instructions so any connecting AI
      knows how to act as a control station
    - Auth-ready: OAuth 2.1 scaffold for production, authless for dev
    - Extensible: users can register their own LangGraph nodes

Transport: Streamable HTTP (current MCP standard for remote servers)

Module shape (post Step 11+ retarget sweep): this file is a thin
routing shell. Tool body implementations live in workflow.api.*
submodules. The @mcp.tool / @mcp.prompt registrations below preserve
FastMCP introspection (chatbot-facing signature + docstring) and
delegate to plain callables in those submodules (Pattern A2).

## Extending Workflow Server with Custom Nodes

The `extensions` tool is the workflow-builder surface. Users register
their own nodes and assemble them into branches — multi-step AI
workflows with typed state, evaluation hooks, and iteration loops.
This is how the platform supports arbitrary domains (research papers,
recipe trackers, screenplays, news summarizers, etc.), not just
fiction. Fantasy authoring is one branch; yours will be another.

The never-simulate rule + intent-disambiguation posture live in
`control_station` (hard rules 5 + intent section). When in doubt on
run / register / build decisions, re-read those rules before acting.

### What a Node Is

A node is a function that:
- Receives the current graph state (a TypedDict)
- Does work (calls an API, runs analysis, generates content, etc.)
- Returns state updates

### Node Contract

Each registered node declares:
- `node_id`: unique identifier (e.g., "weather-generator")
- `display_name`: human-readable name
- `description`: what it does and when it should run
- `input_keys`: which state fields it reads
- `output_keys`: which state fields it writes
- `phase`: where in the workflow it fits (orient, plan, draft, commit,
  learn, reflect, worldbuild, or "custom")
- `source_code`: the Python source (executed in sandbox)
- `dependencies`: pip packages it needs (validated against allowlist)

### How It Works

1. User calls `extensions` with action "register" and the node definition.
2. Server validates the contract and stores the registration.
3. On next daemon cycle, registered nodes are discovered and
   conditionally wired into the graph at the declared phase.
4. Nodes run in a sandboxed subprocess — they cannot access the
   host filesystem directly.

### Safety Model

- Registered nodes run in isolation (subprocess sandbox).
- They receive only the state fields they declared as inputs.
- Their output is validated against declared output keys.
- Nodes that crash or timeout are auto-disabled with a note.
- Host can review, approve, disable, or remove any node.

### Example

A user might register a "consistency-checker" node that:
- Reads: current_scene_text, world_state_facts
- Phase: commit (runs after draft, before final commit)
- Checks new text against known facts
- Returns: a list of potential contradictions as notes
