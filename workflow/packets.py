"""Scene commit packet schema.

A ScenePacket is the structured output of a commit: everything the system
learned from one scene's generation cycle, in machine-readable form.
This is the first layer of the BettaFish-inspired IR pipeline — structured
artifacts instead of loose prose-only outputs.

Every field here corresponds to data the current commit pipeline already
extracts.  No aspirational fields.
