"""Tiered scope handling for multi-universe, multi-goal memory.

The scope layer answers: *for a given row in a memory table, who can see
it, and under what predicate?* Stage 2b reshapes ``MemoryScope`` from the
2026-04-14 nested-narrowing model to the 5-tier orthogonal-composition
model described in ``docs/design-notes/2026-04-15-memory-scope-tiered.md``.

Five tiers, each acting as an independent filter:

1. **Universe.** Hard invariant: no cross-universe read or write.
2. **Goal.** A coherent body of work within a universe.
3. **Branch.** An alternate-history fork of a goal's canon.
4. **User.** Private per-user overlay.
5. **Node.** Per-execution breadth + external-sources declaration
   (see :class:`NodeScope`).

Every tier except universe is optional. ``None`` on any tier means the
caller is not scoped to a specific value for that tier, i.e. they can
see rows at any value of that tier (subject to authorization). Stage 2b
defines the shape + write-side tagging; Stage 2c flips the read-side
predicate on via ``WORKFLOW_TIERED_SCOPE``.

Provides:
  MemoryScope         -- a caller's (universe, goal, branch, user, node) position
  NodeScope           -- node-level breadth + external sources
  SliceSpec           -- narrow-slice retrieval constraints
  ExternalSource      -- declared non-universe knowledge source
  ScopedQuery         -- query parameters scoped by a MemoryScope
  ScopeResolver       -- visibility + write permission logic
  ScopedMemoryRouter  -- MemoryManager wrapper (placeholder; Stage 2c flips)
