"""workflow.gate_events — Real-world outcome attestation primitives.

Schema (schema.py): gate_event + gate_event_cite DDL, GateEvent/GateEventCite dataclasses.
Store (store.py): attest, verify, dispute, retract, get, list storage functions.

Attribution language invariant (load-bearing for all callers):
  Always say "this branch's output was cited in this gate event",
  never "this branch caused the outcome."
