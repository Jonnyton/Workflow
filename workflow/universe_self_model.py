"""Per-universe OKF self-model bundle — the brain's blank, learned identity.

Design note: docs/design-notes/2026-06-25-blank-slate-universe-brain.md (§10).

The self-model is an OKF v0.1 bundle the brain authors *about itself*, kept
separate from the operational soul (soul.md / loop branch / authority). A blank
brain boots with a seed ``index.md`` whose entries are **broken links** to
concept files it has not written yet — per OKF a link to a not-yet-existing
target is "not-yet-written knowledge", and those gaps are the brain's open
questions (its curiosity). As the brain learns, it writes concept ``.md`` files
(with OKF ``# Citations`` as evidence); a question whose concept file exists is
KNOWN, the rest stay open.

This module only stands up + reads the bundle. The brain's learning loop, the
``get_status`` persona surface, and setter retirement are later slices.
