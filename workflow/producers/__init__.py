"""TaskProducer protocol + active registry.

Phase C.3 landing. The protocol is the contract; the registry is the
live list of producers a daemon cycle iterates. No producers register
themselves here in C.3 — that's C.4's job (seed / user_request /
fantasy_authorial each import `workflow.producers` in their domain
init and call ``register(...)``).

See docs/specs/taskproducer_phase_c.md §1 for full contract.
