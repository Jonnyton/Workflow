"""Quality leaderboard + parent-selection — DESIGN-008 (user-buildable selectors).

PR-123 originally shipped this surface with a platform-opinionated
scoring formula baked into Python — weights for runs / forks /
judgments / recency / gates / safe_to_publish all chosen by the
platform. PR #978 tried to patch a bug in that formula (timestamp
coercion); the host closed PR #978 because patching the formula
entrenches the wrong architecture.

DESIGN-008 (host reframe 2026-05-21): selection logic is per-Goal
**user-buildable**. The substrate collects signals; a Goal-bound
**selector branch** synthesizes them into rankings. Selector
branches are normal published Workflow branches conforming to the
contract documented in
``drafts/concepts/selector-branch-contract.md``.

This module now:

* Collects signals per candidate branch (unchanged from the prior
  shape — these are inputs to the selector, not opinion).
* Resolves the Goal's selector branch_version (explicit binding via
  ``set_selector`` OR platform default, see
  ``workflow.api.selector_dispatch``).
* Dispatches the selector synchronously (with timeout) via
  ``execute_branch_version_async`` + ``wait_for``.
* Parses + validates the ``ranked_entries`` output.
* Returns the ranked leaderboard.

What was DELETED in DESIGN-008
------------------------------

* ``W_JUDGMENT`` / ``W_RUNS`` / ``W_FORKS`` / ``W_RECENCY`` /
  ``W_GATE`` / ``W_SAFE_PUBLISH`` / ``W_FAILED_PENALTY`` constants.
  Weights now live in the default selector's prompt.
* ``RECENCY_HALFLIFE_DAYS``, ``JUDGMENT_MAX_SCALE``. Same story.
* ``_score_components`` — the per-term formula application.
* ``_entry_sort_key`` — sort order is selector-emitted ``score``
  desc; ties tolerated.
* ``_formula_disclosure`` — there's no platform formula to
  disclose. Selectors disclose their own logic in their prompt.
* ``_build_rationale`` — rationale is selector-emitted per entry.
* ``_timestamp_to_epoch`` (the PR #978 patch) — never landed on
  main, but the original ``float(...)`` coercion that crashed on
  ISO strings is also gone because signals are now passed as a
  list of dicts to the selector branch, not consumed by Python
  scoring code.

Visibility / auth-boundary contract (preserved from round-2)
------------------------------------------------------------

``viewer`` is the actor identity for which visibility is resolved
and MUST be derived server-side by the caller (never accepted from
an MCP input). Pass an empty string for the strictly-public view.
Private branches authored by the viewer are surfaced in the
candidate set passed to the selector; private branches authored by
other actors are filtered out. The selector's ranking output is
relative to that visibility-bounded candidate set.

Cost note
---------

Each leaderboard build now triggers one LLM call (the selector
run). The old formula was free. Acceptable trade for the
architectural win; a future slice may add caching keyed by
(goal_id, candidate fingerprint) for N minutes.
