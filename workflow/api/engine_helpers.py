"""Preamble engine helpers — extracted from
``workflow/universe_server.py`` (Task #8 — decomp Step 10).

The smallest extraction by LOC (~336 moveable) but the **highest
test-monkeypatch-target burden** of the decomposition: 11 ``mock.patch``
sites + 2 ``monkeypatch.setattr`` sites = 13 test-patch interactions
across 5 test files. This module is the foundation that every Step-1-9
submodule lazy-imports from for ledger attribution, storage backend
resolution, error formatting, and upload-whitelist enforcement. After
Step 10, the dependency-graph inversion is complete: engine_helpers.py
is a leaf module with no upstream dependency on universe_server.py.

Public surface (back-compat re-exported via ``workflow.universe_server``):
    Upload-whitelist trio:
      _upload_whitelist_prefixes()   - return list[Path] | None from
                                       WORKFLOW_UPLOAD_WHITELIST env var
      _split_whitelist_entry(raw)    - cross-platform path-list split
                                       (handles Windows drive-letter colons)
      _warn_if_no_upload_whitelist() - log warning at module-import time
                                       when the whitelist is unset

    Public action ledger trio:
      _current_actor()               - resolve UNIVERSE_SERVER_USER (default
                                       'anonymous'); patched 7+ times in tests
      _append_ledger(udir, action, ..) - durable per-universe ledger writer
      _truncate(text, limit=140)     - whitespace-collapsing string truncator
                                       for ledger summary lines

    Storage + error formatters:
      _storage_backend()             - memoized StorageBackend factory;
                                       patched 4 times in tests
      _format_dirty_file_conflict(exc) - shape DirtyFileError for MCP clients
      _filter_claims_by_branch_visibility(claims, *, viewer) - Phase 6.2.2
                                       private-branch filter for gate claims
      _filter_leaderboard_by_branch_visibility(entries, *, viewer) - sibling
                                       for leaderboard rows
      _format_commit_failed(exc)     - shape CommitFailedError for MCP clients

Cross-module note: `_filter_*_by_branch_visibility` lazy-import
`get_branch_definition` from `workflow.daemon_server` at function-body time
(daemon_server is a sibling, not an api/* submodule). All other engine
helpers depend only on `workflow.api.helpers._base_path` (top-of-module
import) and `workflow.catalog` types (DirtyFileError, CommitFailedError,
get_backend).

The `_warn_if_no_upload_whitelist()` import-time call is intentionally NOT
invoked at engine_helpers.py module load — universe_server.py preserves the
behavior with a lazy-import + invocation at its own module load (Option B
from Step 10 prep §3.5). Otherwise the warning would only fire when
something else imports engine_helpers, missing the at-server-start contract.

Pattern-A2-style leaf inversion: after this extraction, every Steps 1-9
submodule retargets its lazy `from workflow.universe_server import _X`
imports to `from workflow.api.engine_helpers import _X`. universe_server.py
becomes a pure routing/wrapper module (extensions() body + 6 Pattern A2
wrappers + cross-module shims + main).
