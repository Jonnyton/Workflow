"""Canonical-handler resolution for Goal-bound run dispatch — PR-127 (M6).

The M6 cutover (canonical at
``pages/plans/drafts-plans-m6-cutover-retire-cheat-loop-leaderboard-driven-canonical.md``
on the live brain) replaces the hand-wired cheat loop (an env-var
pointing at a single ``WORKFLOW_BUG_INVESTIGATION_BRANCH_DEF_ID``)
with leaderboard-driven canonical selection. Every Goal can opt into
``auto_canonical_via_leaderboard``; when it does, every
``goals action=run_canonical`` call:

  1. Re-queries the quality leaderboard for the freshest top-ranked
     entry.
  2. If the top entry meets ``min_completed_runs_for_canonical``
     (default 5) AND differs from the current canonical AND no
     in-flight run is currently using the prior canonical, the stored
     ``canonical_branch_version_id`` is refreshed via
     :func:`workflow.daemon_server.set_canonical_branch`.
  3. The (possibly updated) canonical is then dispatched.

This module owns the resolution logic. The MCP dispatch wrapper
(``_action_goal_run_canonical`` in ``workflow/api/market.py``) and the
bug-investigation enqueue path (``_maybe_enqueue_investigation`` in
``workflow/bug_investigation.py``) both call into this module so the
leaderboard semantics + threshold + in-flight gating + history audit
have a single source of truth.

No new substrate primitives — pure orchestration over existing
``goals`` / ``branch_versions`` / ``quality_leaderboard`` / ``runs``
storage. The env-var fallback path (read by
``_maybe_enqueue_investigation``) stays in place until the observation
window closes; cutover plan Step 5/6 removes the env in a follow-on PR.

**Auth-boundary contract (PR-127 round 2 — Codex P1 findings):**

* ``_latest_published_version_id`` filters to ``status='active'``
  versions only. Rolled-back / superseded versions can NEVER become
  the auto-refresh target. Defense in depth:
  ``workflow.daemon_server.set_canonical_branch`` also rejects
  non-active versions at the write site, so a bug in this filter
  alone cannot promote a dead version (P1.1).
* The auto-refresh leaderboard query is ALWAYS computed against
  ``viewer=""`` (strictly-public). The caller-supplied viewer is
  retained for log telemetry only; private branches authored by
  the calling actor cannot become the Goal's global canonical via
  auto-refresh (P1.2).

    Round-2 P1.2 fix (Codex round-1 finding on PR #979): the auto-
    refresh decision MUST be computed against a strictly-public
    leaderboard view, regardless of which actor invoked
    ``run_canonical``. The round-1 path forwarded the caller's
    ``viewer`` (== ``_current_actor()``) into the leaderboard, which
    intentionally surfaces private branches authored by that viewer
    (PR-970's auth-boundary contract). The auto-refresh then wrote
    that private branch as the Goal's **global** canonical via
    ``set_canonical_branch``, exposing per-viewer private content to
    every other actor as the default dispatch target.

    Fix: hard-code the leaderboard query's viewer to ``""`` (strictly
    public) here. The caller's ``viewer`` parameter is retained for
    log telemetry — it identifies which actor triggered the refresh —
    but never reaches the leaderboard write decision.

    Round-2 P1.1 fix (Codex round-1 finding on PR #979): the round-1
    implementation returned ``versions[0].branch_version_id`` for the
    most recently published version regardless of status, which let a
    rolled-back version become the auto-refresh target. The repro:
    publish a version, roll it back, give the underlying branch_def
    enough leaderboard signal to rank first, call run_canonical with
    auto_canonical_via_leaderboard=true -> the rolled-back version
    was selected (source=leaderboard_refreshed).

    Fix: filter the version list to ``status == 'active'`` so rolled-
    back / superseded versions are NEVER returned to the auto-refresh
    path. Defense in depth: :func:`workflow.daemon_server.set_canonical_branch`
    also rejects non-active versions, so a bug in this filter alone
