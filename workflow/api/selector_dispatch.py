"""User-buildable selector branch dispatch — DESIGN-008.

The architectural commitment from host's 2026-05-21 reframe: selection
logic is per-Goal user-buildable, NOT platform-coded. ``quality_leaderboard``
no longer applies an opinionated formula; instead it dispatches a
**selector branch** (a published Workflow branch bound to the Goal)
that consumes signal data and emits ranked entries.

This module owns:

* :func:`resolve_selector_branch_version_id` — return the selector
  branch_version_id for a Goal. If ``goal.selector_branch_version_id``
  is set, use it. Otherwise return the platform default selector's
  branch_version_id (lazily published on first call so the substrate
  works on a clean DB).
* :func:`dispatch_selector` — synchronously (with timeout) run a
  selector branch_version against the supplied candidate set, parse
  + validate the output shape, return ``ranked_entries`` or a
  structured error.
* :func:`ensure_default_selector_published` — idempotent helper that
  builds + publishes the platform default selector branch on first
  call. The default is a single prompt-template node that consumes
  the signal map and asks the LLM to rank — the "weights" are a
  prompt the chatbot can tune via fork, not Python constants.

Contract for selector branches (see also
``drafts/concepts/selector-branch-contract.md``):

                },
            },
            ...
        ],
    }

Outputs (read from the run's ``output`` dict)::

    {
        "ranked_entries": [
            {
                "branch_def_id":     "...",

                "rationale":         "<human-readable why-ranked-here>",
            },
            ...  # ordered by rank, best first
        ],
    }

Round-1 design choices
----------------------

* **Sync dispatch with timeout.** The leaderboard caller blocks on the
  selector run via ``wait_for(run_id, timeout=SELECTOR_TIMEOUT_S)``. The
  selector pipeline cost is one LLM call per leaderboard build. A
  future caching slice can memoize results per Goal for N minutes.

* **Visibility is server-derived.** The candidate set passed to the
  selector is the public-or-author-owned view per PR-970's auth-
  boundary contract. The selector branch sees only branches the
  caller has visibility into; private branches authored by other
  actors are never even mentioned in the input.

* **Default selector is a published branch, not a code path.**
  ``ensure_default_selector_published`` builds the BranchDefinition
  in-Python on first call, calls ``save_branch_definition`` +
  ``publish_branch_version``, and stores the resulting
  ``branch_version_id`` for return. Subsequent calls find the
  existing definition and return its current active version.

* **Failure modes surface structured errors.** Selector missing /
  not published / timed out / invalid output shape all return
  ``{"ok": False, "error_kind": "..."}`` dicts that the leaderboard
  caller renders to the chatbot. The leaderboard never crashes;
  callers see a clear "selector misbehaved" signal rather than a
  Python traceback.

_DEFAULT_SELECTOR_PROMPT = """\
You are the **platform default selector** for a Workflow Goal's
leaderboard. Your job is to rank candidate branches that are competing
on the same Goal and emit a JSON array describing the ranking.

## Goal context
goal_id: {goal_id}

## Candidates with collected signals
{candidate_branches}

## Ranking guidance (default — fork this branch to customize)

Consider, in roughly this order of importance:

1. **judgment_score_avg** — average of numeric judgment tags
   (quality/novelty/score). When non-null this is the strongest
   single signal. Treat as ~0-10.
2. **completed_run_count** — more completed runs = more evidence
   this branch actually works. Penalty for `failed_run_count`.
3. **fork_count** — community votes with their forks; high
   fork_count signals influence + endorsement.
4. **last_successful_run_at + age_days_since_success** — recency
   matters; a branch that succeeded yesterday outranks one that
   succeeded six months ago, all else equal.
5. **has_gate_rung / gate_rung_top** — branches that have climbed
   the Goal's gate ladder (real-world impact) outrank those that
   have not.
6. **safe_to_publish** — when present, a strong positive signal.

Branches with no completed runs and no judgments rank below
branches that have *any* signal. A branch with only one completed
run but high judgment_score_avg can still rank well.

## Output

Emit ONLY a JSON object on a single line (no markdown fence, no
prose before or after) with the following shape:

```
{{"ranked_entries":[{{"branch_def_id":"...","branch_version_id":"...","score":<float>,"rationale":"<one sentence>"}},...]}}
```

Order entries best-first. Use the `branch_version_id` from each
candidate if non-empty, otherwise the empty string. `score` should
be on a 0.0-10.0 scale; ties are acceptable. `rationale` is a single
sentence naming the dominant signals (e.g. "highest judgment avg
(8.4) with 12 completed runs and 3 community forks").

If `candidate_branches` is empty, return `{{"ranked_entries":[]}}`.
