"""Continuous single-tab enforcement for the claude.ai CDP browser.

Host-set forever rule: at any moment, the CDP browser must have exactly
one tab. `claude_chat.py` enforces this at command entry, but that only
covers user-sim action windows — tabs opened by host, extensions, or
redirects while user-sim is idle would linger until the next command.

This watchdog runs standalone in the background and polls the CDP
endpoint every ``TAB_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_S`` seconds (default 3). On any
poll where >1 tab is open, it picks the mission tab and closes the rest,
logging each heal to stderr and to ``output/tab_watchdog.log``.

Usage:

    python scripts/tab_watchdog.py &           # background
    python scripts/tab_watchdog.py --once      # single pass for testing

If the CDP endpoint is unreachable (Chrome not launched), the watchdog
sleeps and retries — it never raises. Intended to be launched by
workflow_tray at session start, but safe to run standalone too.
