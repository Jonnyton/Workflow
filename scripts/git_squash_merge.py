"""Squash-merge-aware "is this branch already merged?" detection.

Part of the branch lifecycle automation; see
``docs/design-notes/2026-06-24-branch-lifecycle-automation.md``.

GitHub squash-merges (this repo's default — ``delete_branch_on_merge=true``)
rewrite history: the merged change lands as a brand-new commit on main, so
``git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> main`` returns false even though every
change on the branch is already in main. The original Layer-1 (branch_janitor)
and Layer-2 (wt.py) checks used ``--is-ancestor`` alone, so they were blind to
the *default* merge style — the structural cause of merged branches/worktrees
piling up (the safe teardown path refused the common case, so lanes were either
``--force``-discarded or never torn down).

This module adds the standard squash-detection fallback: synthesize a commit
holding the branch's cumulative tree on top of the merge-base, then ask
``git cherry`` whether that patch is already present on the base ref.
