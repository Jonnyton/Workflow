# run-tunnel.sh — start a Cloudflare tunnel pointing at the local Workflow daemon.
#
# Per docs/exec-plans/active/2026-04-20-selfhost-uptime-migration.md Row C.
# Provider-agnostic: runs on any Linux host (Docker, systemd, direct exec).
#
# Supports both Cloudflare tunnel auth shapes:
#   (a) Token-based (dashboard-managed ingress rules)
#   (b) Config-file-based (ingress rules in deploy/cloudflared.yml)
#
# Select the shape at invocation time by which env vars are set. If both
# are present, token-based wins (matches production 2026-04-19 shape);
# supply only what you want.
#
# Required env (shape a — token):
#     TUNNEL_TOKEN              Cloudflare-issued tunnel token (get from dashboard).
#
# Required env (shape b — config file):
#     TUNNEL_ID                 UUID of the tunnel (cloudflared tunnel list).
#     TUNNEL_CREDENTIALS_FILE   Path to the downloaded tunnel credentials JSON.
#     HOSTNAME                  Public hostname the tunnel serves (e.g. mcp.tinyassets.io).
#
# Optional env (both shapes):
#     ORIGIN_PORT               Local daemon port (default 8001).
#     CLOUDFLARED_BIN           Path to cloudflared binary (default 'cloudflared' on PATH).
#
# Exit codes:
#     0   Tunnel exited cleanly (only reachable on SIGTERM — cloudflared runs until killed).
#     1   Config validation failed — see stderr for which env var is missing.
#     2   cloudflared binary not found.
#
# Notes:
#  - Never logs TUNNEL_TOKEN or credentials-file contents. Token is passed
#    via --token on the CLI (already in the process command line visible
#    to local uid-matching processes; that's cloudflared's own design).
#  - Intended for systemd units, Docker entrypoints, or interactive ops.
#    Don't fork to background; supervisors want foreground PID control.
