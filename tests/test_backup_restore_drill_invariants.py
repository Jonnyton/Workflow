"""Tests for the DR-drill-blocking invariants fixed in Task #12.

Two invariants, both structural (grep-shape), both guarded here so a
future refactor can't silently reintroduce the exit-5 drill abort class
that ate DR drill #3:

  (a) `deploy/backup-restore.sh` must NOT attempt to start the daemon.
      The drill's dedicated "Start compose on drill Droplet" step owns
      that with full retry + probe logic. Coupling caused the restore
      script to exit 5 when cloudflared couldn't initialize without a
      real CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN on the drill droplet — the daemon
      itself was perfectly capable of starting.

  (b) `.github/workflows/dr-drill.yml` "Start compose" step must scope
      to `docker compose up -d daemon` (not a bare `up -d`). Bringing
      up all services on a drill droplet fails hard on cloudflared +
      vector because those require real secrets that don't exist on a
      fresh drill provision.
