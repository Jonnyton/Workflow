"""Integration tests for sub-branch invocation closure (Phase A item 5 / Task #76c).

End-to-end coverage:
- Parent branch with an ``invoke_branch_spec`` node spawns a real child
  through ``execute_branch`` (no mocks on the spawn site).
- ``design_used`` contribution event fires after child success.
- ``child_actor`` flows into the child run's ``actor`` column.

These are slimmer than the unit tests in
``tests/test_sub_branch_invocation.py``: they exercise the full
compile → execute → child-spawn → emit pipeline rather than mocking
``execute_branch`` away.
