"""Task #33 — Sporemarch oscillation fix.

Per user-sim Mission 7: B1-C15-S3 stuck oscillating SECOND_DRAFT scores
across 3+ universe cycles because `_build_book_execution_seed` trusted
the WorkTarget's explicit `metadata.scene_number` unconditionally, even
when that scene file already existed on disk. Each cycle rewrote the
same scene → revision budget reset → word count frozen.

Fix: advance `scene_number` past any existing scene file, even when
the WorkTarget pins an explicit value. Proper root-cause fix
(WorkTarget metadata advance on accept) is filed as a follow-up.
