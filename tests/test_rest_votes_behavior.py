"""Behavioral pins for the REST vote surface after commit 589e1fb.

The existing ``tests/test_author_server_api.py`` exercises the happy
path end-to-end, but it does not pin two specific semantics from
589e1fb that matter if the REST surface ever goes public:

* ``POST /v1/votes/{vote_id}/resolve`` MUST always pass ``force=True``
  to ``author_server.resolve_vote_if_due``. A future patch that
  conditionalizes force (e.g., add an opt-in query flag but default
  to False) would silently regress the documented behavior.

* ``POST /v1/votes/{vote_id}/ballots`` and ``POST /v1/votes/{vote_id}/resolve``
  MUST return a response body shaped as ``{"vote": <result>}``. A
  future patch that unwraps (returning ``result`` directly) or renames
  the wrapper key breaks any public client parsing the shape.

Each test stands alone — no dependency on the full fork-vote flow.
