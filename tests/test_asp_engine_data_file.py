"""BUG-026 — data/world_rules.lp must be present in a standard install layout.

asp_engine.py resolves `_DEFAULT_RULES_PATH` as `parents[2]/data/world_rules.lp`
relative to the module file. In the Docker image the module lives at
`/app/workflow/constraints/asp_engine.py`, so parents[2] = `/app` and the
expected path is `/app/data/world_rules.lp`. The Dockerfile was missing a
COPY for this file, causing ASP validation to silently fail in cloud deploys.

Fix: `COPY data/world_rules.lp /app/data/world_rules.lp` in Dockerfile.

These tests guard that:
1. The resolved path is not None and has the expected suffix.
2. The file actually exists in the working checkout (catches missing/moved file).
3. The file is non-empty and parseable as text (catches empty placeholder).
4. ASPEngine falls back gracefully when the default rules file is absent.
