"""Tests for the ENV-UNREADABLE marker plumbing.

Navigator 2026-04-22 §a/§b fix: the entrypoint and the systemd
ExecStartPre + deploy-prod sed-assertions all emit the same canonical
token so p0-outage-triage.yml can grep journalctl and self-repair
the /etc/workflow/env perm-regression class without an SSH shell.

This test file exercises:
  - docker-entrypoint.sh's ENV-UNREADABLE detection path (all sentinels empty).
  - docker-entrypoint.sh's happy path (at least one sentinel non-empty).
  - That the marker token matches across deploy-prod, entrypoint, systemd unit,
    and p0-outage-triage so auto-triage's grep stays aligned.
