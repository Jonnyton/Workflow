"""Integration test — worldbuild no-op streak guardrail routes graph to END.

Task #6 / Task B. The per-node unit tests in `test_universe_nodes.py` pin
the streak-counter math in `worldbuild()` in isolation. This test wires
worldbuild into a compiled LangGraph and verifies the end-to-end
contract: after `_MAX_WORLDBUILD_NOOP_STREAK` consecutive no-op cycles,
worldbuild sets `health["stopped"]`, and `should_continue_universe`
routes the graph to END.

Why not run the full `build_universe_graph()`?
The real graph starts at `foundation_priority_review`, which reads disk
artifacts and mutates the state far beyond what this test needs. We
build a minimal topology exercising the *exact* wiring under test:

    START -> worldbuild -> universe_cycle -> should_continue_universe
                                               |
                                    cycle -> worldbuild  (loop)
                                      end -> END         (guardrail fired)

`worldbuild` is called with a monkeypatched body so each cycle is a
deterministic no-op (signals_acted == 0, generated_files == []).
`universe_cycle` is the real node — the test needs to prove that
`health` set by worldbuild survives the cycle node and drives the
routing decision, which is precisely the plumbing question.
