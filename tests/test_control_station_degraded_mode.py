"""Tests for control_station directives (hard rules 10 + 11).

Rule 10 (degraded-mode, task #13):
- Devin Session 2 §6 (2026-04-18): chatbot fabricated tier-2 routing
  claims when `get_status` was absent.
- P0 uptime canary probe (2026-04-19): chatbot fabricated a 6-node
  workflow JSON + session history when MCP returned Session terminated.

Rule 11 (shared-account / cross-session, task #5):
- Devin Session 2 (first incident): chatbot asserted host session memory
  as Devin's own history.
- P0 uptime probe: chatbot claimed fabricated prior work from another
  session as the bare-user's lived experience.
- DO-cutover echo: third incident confirmed recurring pattern.
