"""Vocabulary-hygiene regression tests for task #89.

LIVE-F7 (Devin session 1): Claude memory absorbed project-internal
vocabulary ('Universe Server', 'SKILL.md', 'worktree', 'soul files')
from adjacent conversations and leaked it into Devin's tier-2 chat.
System vocabulary bleed is the product experience even when the bleed
is a chatbot-vendor-primitive failure.

Mitigation (task #89): minimize project-internal vocabulary in every
surface Claude's context could absorb — server instructions, MCP
prompts, tool descriptions. Tier-3 contributor surfaces (AGENTS.md,
CONTRIBUTING.md, catalog YAML comments) are explicitly OUT of scope —
those users speak engine-vocabulary natively.

These tests pin the hygiene contract so future edits don't reintroduce
the jargon.

Rationale: docs/audits/user-chat-intelligence/2026-04-19-devin-
session1.md §2.2 LIVE-F7 + §3.2 P-E.
