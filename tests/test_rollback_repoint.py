"""Phase B post-rollback goal-canonical re-point tests (Task #22).

Spec: docs/design-notes/2026-04-25-surgical-rollback-proposal.md §2.4 +
cross-DB refinement note in workflow/rollback.py module docstring.

Covers:
- Cascading walk-up: when both the canonical and its parent are in the
  closure, walk up to the next non-rolled-back ancestor.
- Missing-ancestor edge case: if no eligible ancestor exists, the goal's
  canonical is unset (re-pointed to None).
- Goals NOT pointing into the closure are untouched.
- The repoint dict logs every affected goal.
