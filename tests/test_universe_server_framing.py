"""Tests for the workflow-builder framing + no-simulation rule.

Tasks #27, #28, #34 are text-only fixes to Universe Server prompts and
tool descriptions. The risk isn't that the text is wrong today — it's
that someone later edits the copy back to fiction-only framing or drops
the anti-simulation clause without realizing those lines are load-bearing.

These tests pin the behavioral claims. Copy can be rewritten freely as
long as the guarded intents stay present.
