"""Integration test: commit() -> entity extraction -> KG population.

Verifies that _index_prose_entities correctly wires through to the
KnowledgeGraph when runtime.knowledge_graph is set. This closes the
test gap where all prior tests hit the early-return (kg is None).

NOTE: commit() has two separate extraction paths:
  - Fact extraction (_extract_facts) uses call_for_extraction, which
    hits _mock_extraction_response under _FORCE_MOCK=True (conftest).
  - KG indexing (_index_prose_entities) passes commit.call_provider to
    index_text as provider_call, which we patch to return EXTRACTION_JSON.
These tests target the KG indexing path specifically.

Corin stood on the ridge, one hand resting on Ashka's silver-grey fur.
The wolf pressed against his leg, warm and steady as always. Below them,
Thornwall's thatched roofs caught the last of the evening light. Smoke
curled from the smithy chimney, carrying the scent of iron and pine.

He had been bonded to Ashka since childhood -- seven winters now, since
the day the silver pup had walked out of the Mistwood and refused to leave
his side. The village elders said it was a sign. Corin wasn't sure what it
signified, but he was glad of her company on nights like this, when the
wind came down from the northern peaks and the world felt too large.
