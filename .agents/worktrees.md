# Worktree Inventory

Cross-provider append-only log of worktree create/remove events. Run
`python scripts/worktree_status.py` to see current local state.

GitHub alignment:

- A worktree is the local checkout for one Git branch.
- A branch folds back through a GitHub PR, normally draft while blocked or
  under review and ready only when verification gates pass.
- `STATUS.md` owns claims and file collision boundaries; GitHub owns branch,
  commit, PR, and merge history.
- A branch is not memory. `_PURPOSE.md`, this inventory, `STATUS.md`,
  idea files, and draft PR bodies are the durable memory layer.
- Lane state is one of: Active lane, Parked draft lane, Idea/reference only,
  Abandoned/swept.

Format for future entries:

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - <create|remove|sweep> <slug>

- Provider: <provider/session>
- Branch: <branch>
- Lane state: <Active lane | Parked draft lane | Idea/reference only | Abandoned/swept>
- Worktree: <path>
- STATUS/Issue/PR: <row, issue, or PR URL>
- PLAN refs: <relevant PLAN.md modules reviewed>
- Purpose: <one-line>
- _PURPOSE.md: <path or "missing - retrofit before pickup">
- Memory refs: <prior provider memory/artifact paths>
- Related implications: <STATUS rows, pipeline rows, reports, design notes>
- Idea feed refs: <bottom-of-lane ideas/INBOX.md captures to remember, not build authority>
- Ship/abandon: <PR URL, merge SHA, or abandon reason>
```

## Initial Seed - 2026-05-02

Generated from `git worktree list --porcelain` during the worktree discipline
handoff. Existing worktrees do not all have `_PURPOSE.md` yet; retrofit on
next touch. Do not bulk edit another provider's active worktree metadata.

### Anomalies For Host / Owner Review

These do not conform to the new `../wf-<purpose-slug>` convention or have
unclear ownership. Keep, rename, or sweep only after owner/host review.

Notes:

- `Workflow/origin/main` is nested inside the main checkout and should not be a
  pattern for future worktrees.
- `Workflow-bug037-live2` and `Workflow-scorched-pwa-live` are sibling-prefix
  variants; new work uses `wf-*`.
- Detached `wf-review-NNN` worktrees need `_PURPOSE.md` with PR number and
  close/merge cleanup condition if retained.

- Provider: codex-gpt5-desktop
- Branch: `codex/status-loop-ownership`
- Lane state: Abandoned/swept
- Worktree: `C:\Users\Jonathan\Projects\wf-f2-spec-retire`
- STATUS/Issue/PR: STATUS row "Worktree backlog sweep"
- PLAN refs: Harness And Coordination
- Purpose: remove clean local worktrees whose branches had zero commits not
  reachable from `origin/main`, plus clean detached review worktrees.
- _PURPOSE.md: local ignored purpose file updated for this sweep.
- Memory refs: `.claude/agents/navigator.md`
- Related implications: GitHub/worktree discipline in `AGENTS.md`
- Idea feed refs: none
- Ship/abandon: removed 11 clean merged local branch worktrees and deleted
  their local branches: `codex/bug037-publish-version-topology`,
  `codex/arc-b-phase3`, `codex/bug-011-run-lease-phase-a`,
  `codex/chatgpt-goals-action-alias`, `codex/codex-runtime-proof`,

  and `wf-review-96`. Left dirty, active, live-main, loop-owned, and unique
  clean branches intact.
- Additional local sweep: removed five clean stale worktrees with useful
  payload already folded back or extracted: `wf-cohit-prevention`,
  `wf-bug045`, `wf-provider-compliance-conventions`, and
  `wf-reversible-approval-conventions` were `git cherry` patch-equivalent to
  `origin/main`; `wf-agents-envvars` was extracted into `ff66420`. Deleted
  only local branches/worktrees; remote refs were left intact.
