# Using Agent Skills

## Overview

Agent skills are workflow modules. This meta-skill is the router: pick the
right specialist skill, then follow that skill's process instead of trying to
do everything from memory.

Keep this file thin. Do not stuff specialist guidance into the router when a
dedicated skill should own it.

## Discovery

When a task arrives, identify the dominant need first:

```text
Task arrives
    |
    |-- Unfamiliar area / need bigger map? ----------> zoom-out
    |-- Need to create or update a skill? -----------> skill-authoring
    |-- Vague idea / need refinement? ---------------> idea-refine
    |-- Domain terms drifting / overloaded? ---------> ubiquitous-language
    |-- Need to challenge plan vs domain model? -----> domain-model
    |-- Architecture or modularity audit? -----------> improve-codebase-architecture
    |-- New feature / change with no spec? ----------> spec-driven-development
    |-- Have a spec, need tasks? --------------------> planning-and-task-breakdown
    |-- Implementing code? --------------------------> incremental-implementation
    |   |-- UI work? --------------------------------> frontend-ui-engineering
    |   |-- API / interface work? -------------------> api-and-interface-design
    |   |-- Mostly simplification / clarity? --------> code-simplification
    |   `-- Need better context loaded? -------------> context-engineering
    |-- Writing or running tests? -------------------> test-driven-development
    |   |-- Conditional-edge branch routing? --------> conditional-edge-testing
    |   |-- Browser runtime verification? -----------> browser-testing-with-devtools
    |   `-- Live Claude.ai phone-surface test? ------> ui-test
    |-- Something broke? ----------------------------> debugging-and-error-recovery
    |-- Reviewing code? -----------------------------> code-review-and-quality
    |   |-- Security-sensitive? ---------------------> security-and-hardening
    |   `-- Performance-sensitive? ------------------> performance-optimization
    |-- Removing legacy systems or aliases? ---------> deprecation-and-migration
    |-- CI/CD pipeline or automation work? ----------> ci-cd-and-automation
    |-- Committing / branching / release hygiene? ---> git-workflow-and-versioning
    |-- Cloudflare dashboard or tunnel ops? ---------> cloudflare-ops
    |-- GoDaddy domain / DNS / site ops? ------------> godaddy-ops
    |-- Writing docs or rationale? ------------------> documentation-and-adrs
    |-- Deploying or launching? ---------------------> shipping-and-launch
    `-- Agent-team behavior needs tuning? -----------> team-iterate
```

## Rules

1. Check for an applicable skill before starting substantive work.
2. Use the minimum set of skills that covers the task.
3. Let specialist skills own specialist instructions.
4. When two skills overlap, route by the primary job:
   - `using-agent-skills` chooses.
   - `skill-authoring` writes or updates skills.
   - `domain-model` stress-tests concepts and boundaries.
   - `ubiquitous-language` hardens terminology.
   - `improve-codebase-architecture` audits seams and modularity.
5. Multiple skills can be chained. Example:
   `zoom-out -> improve-codebase-architecture -> planning-and-task-breakdown -> incremental-implementation -> test-driven-development`.

## Core Behaviors

These apply across all skills:

### 1. Surface assumptions

State non-trivial assumptions before acting on them.

```text
ASSUMPTIONS:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
```

### 2. Manage confusion actively

If the spec, code, tests, or docs disagree:

1. Stop.
2. Name the contradiction.
3. Prefer an autonomous default when it is reversible and low-risk.
4. Record unresolved risk in `STATUS.md` or the relevant spec when it matters.
5. Ask the user only when no safe default exists.

### 3. Push back when warranted

Say why an approach is weak, quantify the downside when possible, and propose
the smaller or safer alternative.

### 4. Enforce simplicity

Prefer boring, legible solutions over clever ones. If a dedicated skill exists
for the work, use it instead of inventing a one-off process.

### 5. Maintain scope discipline

Touch only what the task requires. Do not turn one request into an unrelated
cleanup campaign.

### 6. Verify, do not assume

Every task needs evidence: tests, build output, runtime checks, or document
diffs. "Looks right" is not completion.

## Lifecycle

For larger work, the common sequence is:

```text
1. using-agent-skills
2. zoom-out (if the area is unfamiliar)
3. idea-refine or spec-driven-development
4. planning-and-task-breakdown
5. context-engineering
6. incremental-implementation
7. test-driven-development
8. code-review-and-quality
9. documentation-and-adrs
10. git-workflow-and-versioning
11. shipping-and-launch
```

Not every task needs every step. Bug triage might be:
`zoom-out -> debugging-and-error-recovery -> test-driven-development -> code-review-and-quality`.
