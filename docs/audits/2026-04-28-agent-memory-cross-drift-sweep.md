# Agent-memory cross-drift sweep

## TL;DR

5 lead-reviewable findings across 12 agent dirs (~250 memory files total). One real contradiction (verifier vs dev/navigator/lead on `git stash` for diagnostics). One stale-branding gap (lead MEMORY.md still cites "Universe Server" in 2 index entries — same retired branding the rest of the codebase scrubbed earlier this session). Two coverage gaps (dev-2 missing destructive-git rule; SendMessage rule absent from navigator memory). One pattern: triplicate audit-staleness rule across dev/navigator/dev-2 + lead — same lesson, four files.

## Per-agent file count

| Agent dir | MEMORY.md | Files (excl. index) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lead (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`) | yes | 109 (one warns >24KB load-truncated) | Source of truth for cross-cutting principles |
| `developer/` | yes | 38 | Largest of the team-agent dirs; deep code/test patterns |
| `navigator/` | yes | 27 | Strategic + freshness-check patterns |
| `verifier/` | yes | 12 | Test-suite + commit-discipline patterns |
| `planner/` | yes | 9 | Older project artifacts; minimal feedback |
| `dev-2/` | yes | 10 | Floater; this session added 3 new memories |
| `critic/` | yes | 3 | Story/eval-only |
| `reviewer/` | yes | 1 | Single review-patterns doc |
| `tester/` | yes | 1 | pycache-after-rename only |
| `user/` | yes | 3 + personas/ | User-sim patterns |
| `explorer/` | no | 2 | Story context only; no MEMORY.md index |
| `debugger/` | no | 0 | Empty |
| `story-author/` | no | 0 | Empty |

## Findings

| # | Severity | Title | Affected agents | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **DRIFT (contradiction)** | `git stash` for diagnostics — verifier ALLOWS, dev/navigator/lead all FORBID | verifier (allow) vs dev + navigator + lead + dev-2-via-no-rule (forbid) | Resolve: either retire verifier's `feedback_stash_diagnostic.md` OR carve an exception clause into the no-stash rules. Recommend: retire verifier's. The forbid-stash rule is host-explicit (`feedback_git_destructive`); verifier's "diagnostic stash" workaround is the same exception navigator slipped on 2026-04-18 + apologized for. Use `git show HEAD:path` or `git diff HEAD` instead. |
| 2 | **STALE** | Lead MEMORY.md cites "Universe Server" in 2 index entries (L28, L35) | Lead | "MCP Universe Server is the live public interface" + "Restart daemon/Universe Server via tray" — both use retired branding per `tests/test_vocabulary_hygiene.py` LIVE-F7. Replace with "Workflow MCP server" / "the daemon" per the convention scrubbed across `.claude/skills/ui-test/` (Task #17 commit 6ce641f) + 8 user-facing docs (Task #10 this session). |
| 3 | **MISSING-MIRROR** | dev-2 has NO destructive-git rule | dev-2 | dev (`feedback_no_git_stash_for_diagnostics`), navigator (`feedback_no_diagnostic_stash`), lead (`feedback_git_destructive`) all carry it. dev-2 is the floater that swaps into dev tasks — same risk profile, same rule needed. Recommend: add the rule to dev-2 memory (1-line MEMORY.md entry + small file). |
| 4 | **MISSING-MIRROR** | SendMessage rule missing from navigator memory | navigator | dev (`feedback_sendmessage_not_text`) + verifier (`feedback_sendmessage_required`) both carry "plain text doesn't reach lead; always SendMessage." Navigator messages lead constantly during sessions; same rule applies but isn't in navigator memory. Recommend: navigator adds. |
| 5 | **DUPLICATE / NEAR-DUPLICATE (4 copies of audit-staleness rule)** | Audit-staleness pattern lives in 4 agent memories with different framings | dev (`feedback_audits_often_stale.md`), navigator (`feedback_audit_freshness_check.md`), lead (`feedback_audit_freshness_check.md`), dev-2 (`feedback_audits_can_be_already_done.md`) | Same load-bearing rule across 4 files, 4 framings, 4 examples. Could be: (a) accepted as fine — different agents need different framings of the same rule. (b) consolidated to one canonical file in lead memory with cross-refs. **My take:** keep as-is. Each memory captures the example most relevant to that role (dev hit it on extractions, navigator on prescriptions, dev-2 on classify-from-scratch tasks, lead on dispatch). Consolidating would lose the role-specific examples. Just flag for awareness. |

## Other observations (informational, not action items)

### A. Lead MEMORY.md is overflowing the load budget

L1 of lead's MEMORY.md shows: `> WARNING: MEMORY.md is 24.5KB (limit: 24.4KB) — index entries are too long. Only part of it was loaded. Keep index entries to one line under ~200 chars.`

This means lead memory is being truncated at load time. ~109 files indexed in 1 file at the budget edge. Recommend lead trim entries to ~150 chars or split across themed indexes (e.g. `MEMORY-process.md`, `MEMORY-product.md`).

### B. Coverage map of important rules across agents

Sampled 6 cross-cutting rules:

| Rule | Lead | Dev | Dev-2 | Nav | Verifier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Run `build_plugin.py` after canonical edits | (project_plugin_mirror_collision via nav) | yes | no | yes | no | dev-2 + verifier could use it |
| Audit freshness / spot-check before classify | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | verifier could use it; dev-2 + nav + lead converge here |
| Daemon default behavior (1 always-on, normal state) | yes | no | no | yes | no | dev/dev-2 don't need it (orthogonal to code work); lead+nav have product axis covered |
| `git stash` is destructive — don't use for diagnostics | yes | yes | **NO** (gap) | yes | **YES BUT INVERTED** (uses for diagnostics) | finding #1 + finding #3 |
| SendMessage required for teammate-channel reply | (implicit) | yes | (implicit; not flagged) | **NO** (gap) | yes | finding #4 |
| Commit only on verifier SHIP | yes | yes | (implicit) | yes | yes | well-mirrored |

### C. Personas under user/ memory — not a content issue, structural note

`.claude/agent-memory/user/personas/` exists but contains the live persona files for user-sim missions (Mara, Mark, Devin, etc.). These are state-rich and session-driven — not memory in the lead-cutting-cross-agent-rules sense. Out of scope for this audit; flagging that they exist so a future "memory file count" sweep doesn't lump them together.

### D. Some old planner files are pre-rename relics

`planner/` has `project_phase7_github_canonical.md`, `project_judge_strategy.md`, `project_continuity_gap.md` — all 2026-04-09–14 era artifacts that predate the current daemon-economy + decomp + rename arcs. They're not contradicting current truth; they're just historical decisions that may not be load-bearing for current planner work. Optional cleanup item; not a finding.

### E. `dev-2/MEMORY.md` is small (10 entries) — could absorb more cross-cutting rules

dev-2 is the floater role per `feedback_floating_fifth_teammate` (lead memory). It swaps onto dev tasks regularly. Likely candidates to absorb: `feedback_run_build_plugin_after_canonical_edits`, `feedback_no_git_stash_for_diagnostics` (finding #3), `feedback_three_mirrors_dist_may_diverge`, `feedback_silence_after_ack`. The first two are high-value; others are situational.

## Suggested fix sequence (lead-driven)

1. **Finding #1 — verifier stash conflict.** Highest priority. Resolve the dev/navigator/lead-vs-verifier divergence on `git stash`. Verifier's diagnostic-stash workflow is the failure mode the no-stash rule was created to prevent.

2. **Finding #2 — lead MEMORY.md "Universe Server" stale refs.** Lowest effort, highest user-facing risk. 2-line edit. Lead memory feeds back into Claude memory across sessions — branding hygiene matters.

3. **Findings #3 + #4 — coverage gaps.** Add the missing rule entries to dev-2 + navigator memories. ~5 min each.

4. **Observation A — lead memory budget overflow.** Decide how to split or trim lead's MEMORY.md. Could be 30-min cleanup. Important because the truncation means lead currently isn't loading its full memory at session start.

5. **Finding #5 + Observation E — leave as-is.** No action; flagged for awareness only.

## Verifier handoff

This is a recommendation document, not an applied edit. Lead reviews + applies. No agent memory has been edited by this audit pass.

No code touched. No test files touched. No dev #18 lock-set touched.
