# Launch-Readiness Checklist

**Status:** v1. Living document — PR changes per `SUCCESSION.md` §1.7 admin-pool rule.
**Last updated:** 2026-04-19.
**Owner:** admin pool (joint).

Single authoritative gate. **Every box below MUST be checked before any public launch announcement.** No soft "we'll fix it after launch" items; this list is the launch-blocking set. Nice-to-haves live elsewhere.

---

- [ ] **`workflow_analytics` Postgres role** created + training-excluded fields access-revoked (per spec #25 §2.6).
- [ ] **`training_excluded = true` structural enforcement verified** — any query as `workflow_analytics` role errors on training-excluded rows (smoke test green).

## J. Safety + legal

- [ ] **Privacy policy live at `tinyassets.io/legal/privacy`**.
- [ ] **Terms of Service live at `tinyassets.io/legal/terms`**.
- [ ] **`docs/catalogs/privacy-principles-and-data-leak-taxonomy.md` v1 published** + referenced by chatbot instructions.

- [ ] **Public status page** (either `/status` on the app or a separate status.tinyassets.io) live.

## L. Anthropic connector submission

- [ ] **Submission filed** with Anthropic directory.
- [ ] **Manual-paste fallback tested** on `/connect` page (user copies → pastes → first tool call lands in <60s).

---

## Non-blocking (fast-follow post-launch)

- `/account` delete-account + data-export — spec #35 §8, but fast-follow acceptable if 30-day grace is documented in ToS.
- `/earnings` web dashboard — tier-2 hosts can use tray dashboard at launch; web mirror is nice-to-have.
- OG image auto-generation — default OG image works; per-node OG is growth multiplier.
- Multi-language launch — English-only per memory `project_q13_q14_resolutions.md`; chatbot translates at tier-1 level.
- Linux .AppImage in addition to .deb — .deb covers Ubuntu/Debian majority.
- Package manager ingestion (`brew install`, `winget install`) — direct download works at launch.

## What counts as "green"

A checkbox is green only when:
1. **Verified by evidence** — a link to CI run, a screenshot, or a live URL that proves the assertion.
2. **Within 30 days of the launch date** — stale verifications don't count.
3. **Signed off by at least one admin-pool member who is NOT the person who verified it** — two-person accountability per `project_host_independent_succession.md`.

---

## Launch decision

When ALL boxes are green AND the admin pool agrees:
- Host posts the launch announcement.
- SUCCESSION.md `last-updated` timestamp bumped to launch date.
- First on-call shift begins.

If even one box is red at launch-decision time:
- Document why in a `launch-blocker` file.
- Either: fix the box, OR explicitly accept the risk + document the fast-follow commit.

**"Launch with known risks" is allowed — "launch without knowing" is not.**
