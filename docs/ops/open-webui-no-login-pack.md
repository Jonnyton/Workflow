# Open WebUI No-Chatbot-Login Pack

Date: 2026-05-01
Status: verified local Docker proof on 2026-05-01
Owner: lead + available provider

This pack is the first no-hosted-chatbot-login path for Workflow. It is for
users who do not want or cannot use Claude/ChatGPT app directories, but can run
or access an Open WebUI instance.

## Current Truth

- Open WebUI docs say native MCP support starts in Open WebUI `v0.6.31+`.
- Native MCP support is `MCP (Streamable HTTP)` only.
- Workflow exposes a public Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at
  `https://tinyassets.io/mcp-directory`.
- The full custom-connector endpoint remains `https://tinyassets.io/mcp`, but
  the directory endpoint is the safer first proof surface because it exposes
  only 11 narrow tools.

Public claim scope: Open WebUI 0.9.2 local Docker proof is verified against
Workflow's directory endpoint. Do not generalize that claim to every Open WebUI
version, hosted deployment, auth mode, model, or write/proposal flow without a
host-specific proof update.

## Recommended Open WebUI Settings

In Open WebUI:

1. Open `Admin Settings -> External Tools`.
2. Add a server.
3. Set `Type` to `MCP (Streamable HTTP)`.
4. Set `Server URL` to:

```text
https://tinyassets.io/mcp-directory
```

5. Set authentication to `None`.
6. Leave the function-name filter empty for the first connection proof.
7. Save. Restart Open WebUI if prompted.

Optional hardening after first proof:

```text
get_workflow_status,list_workflow_goals,search_workflow_wiki,read_workflow_wiki_page,list_workflow_runs
```

Use the optional filter only after proving the unfiltered directory endpoint
connects, because the filter itself can become the source of setup failures.

## User-Facing First Prompts

Use read-only prompts first:

```text
Use Workflow to check the daemon status and tell me any caveats.
```

```text
Use Workflow to list available goals.
```

```text
Use Workflow to search the Workflow wiki for launch risks and summarize the best match.
```

Only test write/propose flows after read-only invocation is visible in the chat
and Open WebUI's approval/tool-call UX is understood.

## Troubleshooting Notes

- If the connection fails, verify the tool type is `MCP (Streamable HTTP)`, not
  OpenAPI.
- If auth is set to `Bearer` without a key, Open WebUI may send an empty
  authorization header. Use `None` for Workflow's current public directory
  endpoint.
- If Open WebUI runs in Docker and the MCP server is on the host machine, Open
  WebUI docs recommend `host.docker.internal`. That is not needed for
  `https://tinyassets.io/mcp-directory` because it is a public HTTPS endpoint.
- Open WebUI recommends setting `WEBUI_SECRET_KEY` for stable OAuth-connected
  tools. Workflow's directory endpoint does not require OAuth today, but a
  stable key is still a good Open WebUI deployment practice.

## Runtime Proof Checklist

Record all values before claiming support:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Open WebUI version | `0.9.2` |
| Deployment shape | local Docker, `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main` |
| Workflow endpoint | `https://tinyassets.io/mcp-directory` |
| Auth mode | None |
| Function filter | empty for first proof |
| Model used | `qwen3.5-nothink:latest` |
| Prompt | `Use the Workflow tool to call get_workflow_status...` |
| Visible tool result | Open WebUI source `workflow_get_workflow_status`; answer said `reachable=true` from `universe_exists=true` |
| Screenshot/trace path | `docs/ops/open-webui-runtime-proof-2026-05-01.md` |
| Date/time | 2026-05-01 UTC |

Acceptance criteria:

- Open WebUI adds the Workflow MCP server without crashing or infinite loading.
- A chat can invoke at least one read-only Workflow tool.
- The visible response matches the tool result enough for a user to trust it.
- Any console/server error is recorded.
- `docs/ops/mcp-host-proof-registry.md` is updated to `verified` with the
  proof date and trace path.

## Supporting Protocol Checks

Run these before and after the Open WebUI proof:

```powershell
python scripts/mcp_public_canary.py --url https://tinyassets.io/mcp-directory --timeout 15 --verbose
python scripts/mcp_probe.py --url https://tinyassets.io/mcp-directory tools
```

Expected directory tools:

- `get_workflow_status`
- `list_workflow_universes`
- `inspect_workflow_universe`
- `list_workflow_goals`
- `search_workflow_goals`
- `get_workflow_goal`
- `search_workflow_wiki`
- `read_workflow_wiki_page`
- `list_workflow_runs`
- `propose_workflow_goal`
- `submit_workflow_request`
