title: Wiki bug-report convention — paste-ready code patches

# Paste-ready code patches

Substrate patches for the canonical design at
`2026-04-20-wiki-bug-reports-convention.md`. Dev applies them once
verifier has cleared Task #1 + Task #2 landings (both are `completed`
in the task system as of 2026-04-20). Order matters — (a) must land
before (e) because `_WIKI_CATEGORIES` gates `_wiki_write` and thus
also gates `_wiki_file_bug`'s fallback path. (c) and (d) are
independent text edits.

**Landing order:** (a) → (b) → (e) → (d) → (c). Then dev or a chatbot
runs `wiki action=file_bug ...` using the seed entries in the sibling
file.

All line numbers taken from the working tree as of 2026-04-20 after
Task #1 / #2 landed. If line numbers drift in your working copy,
match on the `old_string` anchor — the anchors are unique in the
file.

---

## (a) Add `"bugs"` to `_WIKI_CATEGORIES`

**File:** `workflow/universe_server.py` (line 9056-9066).

**Mirror file:** `packaging/claude-plugin/plugins/workflow-universe-server/runtime/workflow/universe_server.py`
at the matching `_WIKI_CATEGORIES = (` block. Apply identically.

+    "bugs",        # Auto-filed server defects (one file per BUG-NNN, never drafts-gated)
 )
```

The comment block above the tuple (lines 9051-9055) mentions mirroring
`wiki-mcp/server.js` — that mirror is patch (b).

---

## (b) Add `"bugs"` to wiki-mcp/server.js category taxonomy

**File:** `C:/Users/Jonathan/Projects/wiki-mcp/server.js` (a sibling
repo at `C:/Users/Jonathan/Projects/wiki-mcp/`, not inside Workflow).
Dev needs to clone/open the sibling repo to land this patch.

Five edits required in that file:

## (c) Insert rule 11 into `_CONTROL_STATION_PROMPT`

**File:** `workflow/universe_server.py` (between line 943 and 944 —
end of rule 10, before blank line preceding `## Tool Catalog`).

that follows — that anchor is unique to the end of rule 10.

     trust depends on being able to tell the difference between "this
     came from the connector" and "the chatbot made this up" — when the
     connector is down, the answer must be "I can't reach it right now,"
     not a plausible-looking artifact. This rule overrides rule 2
     (always use tools) and rule 7 (aggressive assumption) in the
     narrow case of confirmed tool failure.

+11. File server defects to the wiki; don't silently work around them.
+    When any tool against this connector returns a malformed result,
+    silent corruption, schema mismatch, or obvious misbehavior, file a

+    severity=<critical|major|minor|cosmetic> title="<short>"
+    repro="<tool call>" observed="<what you saw>"
+    expected="<what you expected>"`. The server assigns the BUG-NNN
+    id — don't invent one. Log it even if you apply a workaround and
+    continue the user's task; the log is how the host fixes the bug.
+    User-caused errors (invalid args, missing universe, etc.) are not
+    bugs — don't log those.
+
 ## Tool Catalog (4 coarse tools — describe ALL when asked)
```

Word count of rule 11 body: 95 words. Meets the <100 target.

No change needed for `_EXTENSION_GUIDE_PROMPT` or other prompts.

## (d) `wiki` tool docstring — advertise `file_bug` + `bugs` category

**File:** `workflow/universe_server.py` (wiki tool args docstring,
lines 9298-9319).

Two edits: (d1) extend the `action` enumeration in the docstring to
include `file_bug`; (d2) extend the `category` enumeration to
include `bugs`; (d3) add new args for `file_bug` parameters in the
signature + docstring.

Also add to the `kwargs` dict inside the tool body (around line

### Notes on the sketch

- **Atomic create (`open(..., 'x')`) is the race guard.** `_next_bug_id`
  is not transactional, so two chatbots racing both compute the same
  `max+1`. The atomic create fails on the second writer, `_next_bug_id`
  gets re-called (seeing the fresh file), and the retry takes the
  next id. This is the cheapest cross-platform solution that works
  without introducing a file-lock dependency.
- **Mirror:** packaging-plugin file needs the same helper if the
  plugin ships its own copy of `universe_server.py`. Grep first
  — if it re-imports from the core module, no second copy needed.
- **Tests:** dev lands unit tests covering: empty dir → BUG-001,
  existing BUG-007 → BUG-008, non-integer `BUG-xyz.md` is ignored,
  collision retry advances the id, invalid severity rejected,
  missing required args rejected. Put tests in
  `tests/test_wiki_file_bug.py` — use `tmp_path` as the wiki root
  and monkey-patch `_wiki_pages_dir` / `_wiki_drafts_dir`.
- **No `wiki-mcp/server.js` mirror for `file_bug`.** That server is
  the read-only-wiki bridge for Claude Code sessions; chatbots on the
  Workflow connector file bugs through the Workflow server directly.
  The `bugs` category entry in (b) is enough for wiki-mcp to render
  + search bug pages; writing is routed through the Workflow MCP.

## Landing checklist for dev

1. [ ] Apply (a) to `workflow/universe_server.py` + its packaging
       mirror.
2. [ ] Apply (b1-b5) to `C:/Users/Jonathan/Projects/wiki-mcp/server.js`.
3. [ ] Apply (e) — new `_wiki_file_bug` helper + allocator + renderer.
4. [ ] Apply (d1-d4) — docstring + signature + dispatch.
5. [ ] Apply (c) — control_station rule 11.
6. [ ] Run `ruff check` on touched Python files (per
       `feedback_dev_ruff_discipline`).
7. [ ] Tests — `tests/test_wiki_file_bug.py` covers the allocator,
       renderer, collision retry, and validation. Dev writes these
       from scratch (no existing test file to extend).
8. [ ] Handoff to chatbot / manual: run the two `wiki action=file_bug`
       calls from `2026-04-20-wiki-bug-reports-seed-entries.md` to
       seed BUG-001 + BUG-002.
9. [ ] Update task descriptions for Task #1 + Task #2 with
       `wiki:bugs/BUG-001-...` / `BUG-002-...` back-references.

Rough effort estimate: one dev day. (a) + (c) + (d) are ~30 min
total; (b) depends on the sibling-repo tooling; (e) + tests are the
bulk. No architectural risk — existing wiki infrastructure handles
reads/search/list once `"bugs"` is in `_WIKI_CATEGORIES`.
