# Provider Identity Bridge

Status: proposed capture from 2026-05-02 host direction. Not yet promoted into
`PLAN.md` because `PLAN.md` is currently claimed by another lane.

## Problem

The same human may reach Workflow through Claude, ChatGPT, Codex, OpenClaw,
local IDE hosts, and future MCP clients. The product goal is that the user can
control their own daemons, capacity grants, money-adjacent balances, and
connected account assets from whichever logged-in chatbot they are using.

The unsafe shortcut is treating "the chatbot session is logged in" as Workflow
account authority by itself. Provider login proves that the user is logged into
that provider account. It does not prove which Workflow account it should bind
to, which daemon/runtime/capacity scopes it controls, or whether money,
credential, or account-access authority has been delegated.

## Proposed Boundary

Use a provider identity bridge:

1. Workflow account identity remains canonical. Launch design currently names
   GitHub OAuth as the first identity primitive, with native accounts later if
   needed.
2. Each chatbot/provider identity becomes a verified external identity binding
   on the Workflow account: `provider`, `provider_subject`, verification time,
   assurance level, scopes, revocation status, and last proof.
3. Binding a provider requires an explicit linking ceremony: OAuth/PKCE where
   available, or a signed one-time nonce shown in Workflow and returned through
   the provider client. A provider session cannot self-assert ownership.
4. Once linked, low-risk reads and reversible controls may feel automatic from
   that provider, but every operation still checks tenant, owner, grant,
   runtime lease, state scope, target version, and action class.
5. High-risk classes stay gated even for linked sessions: irreversible actions,
   credential custody, external account writes, financial/crypto transfers,
   regulated submissions, and final publish/submit boundaries.
6. For crypto or money-like flows, Workflow may prepare, validate, simulate,
   queue, explain, and hand off. It must not execute prohibited transfers on
   the user's behalf. Reversible internal ledger proposals can be batched only
   when the reversal semantics are real and tested.

## Relationship To Existing Plan

This follows existing constraints rather than replacing them:

- `PLAN.md` already says GitHub OAuth is the launch identity primitive and
  sessions are scoped per user.
- `PLAN.md` says human control belongs at irreversible boundaries and
  reversibility earns batched autonomy.
- `PLAN.md` says provider compliance is a product boundary: Workflow can
  prepare, explain, validate, simulate, or hand off provider-forbidden actions,
  but cannot disguise the final prohibited action as daemon work.
- `docs/design-notes/2026-05-01-hostless-byok-cloud-daemon-capacity.md`
  requires ownership-scoped control semantics, no subscription cookie/session
  scraping, broker-only credential use, scoped write proxies, budget
  reservation, revocation, and simulated multi-user proof.

## Open Questions

- Which provider bindings are acceptable for launch besides GitHub OAuth?
- Does ChatGPT/OpenAI app identity expose a stable subject suitable for account
  linking, or must first launch use a Workflow-side nonce?
- Which actions can be made genuinely reversible enough for checkpoint/batched
  approval, and which must stay final-step handoff?
- What is the minimum simulated multi-user test proving that Claude, ChatGPT,
  Codex, and OpenClaw sessions cannot cross-control another user's daemon,
  capacity, money-like grants, or connected accounts?

## Next Step

Current STATUS lane:

- Proposed branch: `codex/provider-identity-bridge`
- Proposed worktree: `../wf-provider-identity-bridge`
- PR expectation: draft PR until the current `PLAN.md` owner clears or
  explicitly coordinates the edit
- First write set: this note plus `PLAN.md`; implementation files are not
  chosen yet

Do not implement runtime identity or account-control code from this capture
alone. First refactor the lane against current auth/control-plane work, active
review gates, prior-provider memory refs, and related compliance implications.
