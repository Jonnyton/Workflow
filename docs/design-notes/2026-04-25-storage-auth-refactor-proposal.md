# Storage-Layer Authority Refactor — Defense-in-Depth Auth

**Date:** 2026-04-25
**Author:** dev-2
**Status:** Design proposal. Closes the load-bearing gap from navigator's #65 pair-read finding — storage-layer is permissive today; authority enforced only at MCP perimeter.
**Builds on:** Task #47 §4 (variant-canonical authority model); Task #57 §5 (rollback_merge host-only assertion); navigator's #65 pair-read.
**Scope:** schema/contract design only. No code changes.

---

## 1. Recommendation summary

Add explicit `actor_id` arg to high-blast-radius storage helpers + introduce small policy module `workflow/storage/authority.py`. Each helper calls a `check_*_authority(base_path, actor_id, ...)` function at the top; `AuthorizationError` is raised on denial; MCP layer translates to structured error.

**Top tradeoff axis:** **least magic vs. least boilerplate.** Going least-magic — explicit args are easiest to test, debug, and audit. Boilerplate cost is bounded (~6 helpers in Phase 1).

**Concrete gap (verbatim from `daemon_server.py:2453-2475` `set_canonical_branch` docstring):**

> "Only the Goal author or a host-level actor may set canonical. **Caller must validate authority before calling this function.**"

The `set_by` arg today is for AUDIT TRAIL, not authorization. Today's storage layer trusts callers. This proposal closes that gap for high-blast-radius writes.

---

## 2. Schema sketch — `workflow/storage/authority.py`

```python
# workflow/storage/authority.py — NEW module
"""Defense-in-depth authority checks for storage-layer writes.

Today's storage helpers trust callers: docstrings say "caller must
validate authority." This module replaces that contract with explicit
checks at the storage boundary. Composes with MCP-layer perimeter
checks for defense in depth.

The module is small, stdlib-only, no business logic beyond authority lookup. Each function is independently testable.

## 3. Tradeoff vs alternatives

| Axis | Explicit `actor_id` arg + policy module (recommended) | Authority-as-decorator | Authority-as-context-manager |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auth visible at call-site** | YES — every call shows actor_id in args | Hidden behind decorator | Hidden inside `with` block |
| **Testability** | Each check is a pure function callable from tests | Decorator + decorated function couple | Context-manager state requires fixture setup |
| **Failure mode on forget** | Type error (missing arg) | Silent — decorator may not be applied | Silent — forgot to enter `with` |
| **Debuggability** | actor_id in stack frame at every step | Decorator wrapper hides actor_id | Thread-local; harder to inspect |
| **Per-helper boilerplate** | One `actor_id` arg + one check call | One `@requires_auth` line | Caller-side `with` boilerplate |
| **Composability with TYPE_CHECKING / lazy imports** | Trivial | Decorator chain complications | OK |

Going option 1. The "forgot to apply decorator / forgot to enter context" failure modes silently disable auth — exactly the defense-in-depth gap we're trying to close.

---

## 4. Phase 1 helpers (high blast radius — covered now)

Six helpers gain `actor_id` arg + `check_*_authority` calls:

| Helper | Location | Operation | Authority check |
|---|---|---|---|
| `set_canonical_branch` | `daemon_server.py:2453` | Set/unset goal canonical (default scope) | `check_set_canonical_authority(scope_token="")` |
| `set_canonical_binding` | NEW (per #47 Steps 2-3) | Write canonical_bindings row (any scope) | `check_set_canonical_authority(scope_token=row.scope_token)` |
| `update_branch_definition` | `daemon_server.py:2135` | Edit live branch def | `check_branch_definition_authority(operation="update")` |
| `save_branch_definition` | `daemon_server.py:1971` | Create new branch def | `check_branch_definition_authority(operation="save")` (no-op for create) |
| `delete_goal` | `daemon_server.py:2635` | Soft-delete goal | `check_delete_goal_authority` |
| `mark_branch_version_rolled_back` | NEW (per #57 implementation) | Roll back a published version | `check_rollback_authority` |

**Structural callout — `set_canonical_binding` is Phase 1 by definition.** It's the ONLY production write-path for the new `canonical_bindings` table. Auth lands at first-use, NOT as a retrofit. The story stays clean: every binding ever written goes through the new authority module.

### v2 deferral (lower blast radius)

| Helper | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| `update_goal` | Edits gate ladder, visibility flips. Important but not catastrophic. v2 covers. |
| `save_goal` | Initial create — caller becomes author by definition; nothing to check against. |
| `record_event` | Audit-log writes within-process; broad-trust, not security-load-bearing. |
| `save_node_definition` | Node-level edits; less load-bearing than branches; v2. |
| `update_run_status` | Run state transitions; trusted internal callers. v2. |

The v2 set follows the same recipe later — Phase 1 is the high-blast-radius slice that ships first.

---

## 5. Migration plan — 4-step additive

### Step 0 — define authority module

Create `workflow/storage/authority.py` with `AuthorizationError` + the 4 `check_*_authority` functions. Tests cover each rule in isolation:

- `check_set_canonical_authority` — actor=goal.author allowed, actor=host allowed, actor=stranger denied, scope=user:self allowed, scope=user:other denied, scope=tier:* denied (current).
- `check_rollback_authority` — actor=host allowed, actor=anyone-else denied.
- `check_branch_definition_authority` — operation=save no-op, operation=update author-or-host gated, missing branch_def_id raises clearly.
- `check_delete_goal_authority` — author-or-host gated.

### Step 1 — Phase 1 helpers gain optional `actor_id` arg

Each helper signature gains `actor_id: str = "host"` (backward-compat default). NEW callers pass real actor; OLD callers fall through with host privileges. Add deprecation warning emitted via `warnings.warn` whenever the default is used (logs to operator).

### Step 2 — Helpers call `check_*_authority` at the top

Each helper's first action (after `initialize_author_server(base_path)`) is to call its appropriate authority check. Rejected calls raise `AuthorizationError`; MCP layer's `_dispatch_*_action` wrappers translate to `{"status": "rejected", "error": str(exc), "authority_required": exc.operation}` per Q1 below.

### Step 3 — Flip default after callers migrated

Two-week sunset window. After all production callers (universe_server.py, scripts, tests) pass `actor_id` explicitly, remove the default. Callers must pass it; missing arg → `TypeError`.

**Rollback safety:** if Step 2 surfaces a regression (e.g., a forgotten internal caller), revert Step 2 only — Step 0 + Step 1 stay. Helpers ignore `actor_id` until Step 2 re-lands. No data loss.

---

## 6. Composition with sibling proposals

### Task #57 surgical rollback — defense in depth

`runs action=rollback_merge` enforces host-only at MCP layer (#57 §5). Storage-side helpers `mark_branch_version_rolled_back` + `repoint_canonical_to_parent` (both will land in #57 implementation) MUST call `check_rollback_authority(actor_id)`.

If the MCP layer is bypassed (direct `daemon_server` call from another process, test code that forgets to validate, future internal automation), storage-layer prevents the action. **The MCP-layer check is one barrier; storage-layer check is the second.** Defense-in-depth literal — both must hold for rollback to fire.

### Task #47 variant canonicals — lifts §4 authority model

`set_canonical_binding` (when implemented per #47 Steps 2-3) gains `actor_id` + calls `check_set_canonical_authority(actor_id, goal_id, scope_token)`. The authority rules in `check_set_canonical_authority` are a literal lift of #47 §4 authority model:

- `scope_token == ''` → goal author or host (current set_canonical behavior).
- `scope_token == 'user:<actor>'` → that actor only.
- `scope_token.startswith('tier:'/'team:')` → policy-pending; reject with informative error referencing #47 §6 Q1/Q2.

### Task #48 contribution ledger — orthogonal

`record_contribution_event(..., actor_id=...)` already requires the actor as a row field (event author). NOT auth-related at the storage layer — the ledger is append-only, every actor records their own events. `actor_id` for events is identity, not authorization.

### Task #66 TypedPatchNotes — orthogonal

`patch_notes.author_actor_id` is required (#66 §2). When patch_notes flow through gate evaluation, the storage helpers writing the resulting events read `notes.author_actor_id` for ledger field population. NOT auth-related — author identity, not write permission.

### Cross-process / federation — punt to v2

Today's daemon is single-process. Future multi-process / federated deployments (per `project_host_independent_succession`) need shared authority enforcement across daemons. This proposal does NOT design that. v2 covers. Note in §7 Q3.

---

## 7. Open questions

1. **AuthorizationError → MCP error class mapping.** RECOMMENDED: new `_format_authorization_error(exc)` helper in `workflow/universe_server.py` returning `{"status": "rejected", "error": str(exc), "authority_required": exc.operation, "actor_id": exc.actor_id}`. Standard MCP error shape; chatbot can render "you can't do X; <reason>." Closed.

2. **Host actor identification.** RECOMMENDED: keep using `os.environ.get("UNIVERSE_SERVER_HOST_USER", "host")` via `_host_actor()` helper in this module. Single source of truth; storage authority module imports the same env helper that universe_server.py + #57 use. Don't fork. Closed.

3. **Cross-process policy enforcement.** RECOMMENDED: punt to v2. Today's single-process daemon doesn't need it; federation work surfaces it. Doc in §6. Closed.

4. **Authority caching.** RECOMMENDED: recompute on every check. SQLite query to fetch `goal.author` is sub-millisecond; cache-invalidation complexity is not earned. Closed.

5. **(Truly open) Goal author transferability.** Today `goals.author` is immutable; if an author leaves, no one but host can change canonical for their goals. Should there be a `transfer_goal_authority` primitive? RECOMMENDED: defer — different concern (governance), shouldn't load-bear on this auth refactor. Surface as a separate proposal once a real user need surfaces. Open.

6. **(Truly open) AuthorizationError as engine signal.** When a sub-branch invocation raises AuthorizationError mid-graph (per Task #56), what's the parent's contract? Recommend: AuthorizationError is a subclass of ValueError-equivalent at the engine boundary; the parent's `on_child_fail` policy (from #56 §4) governs propagation — `propagate` default raises in parent context; `default` falls through; `retry` re-fires (will fail again, bounded by retry_budget). Open.

---

## 8. What this proposal does NOT cover

- **No code changes.** Design only; lead routes implementation as separate dispatch.
- **No v2-deferred helpers.** `update_goal` / `save_node_definition` / `record_event` / etc. — same recipe applies later.
- **No MCP-layer changes.** Existing perimeter checks at MCP handlers stay as-is. This proposal adds a SECOND layer; doesn't replace the first.
- **No federation / multi-process auth.** §6 Q3 deferral.
- **No goal author transferability.** §7 Q5 deferral.
- **No revocation / time-bounded authority.** Auth is current-state only; "actor X had auth at time T but lost it later" is not modeled. Future feature.
- **No cross-tenant isolation.** When tenants share artifact lineage, authority compositions get tricky; out of scope here.
