"""Ingestion framework -- file type detection, routing, and synthesis signals.

Handles incoming files (via API or direct drop) and routes them:
- Small files (<=5KB): directly to canon/
- Large files (>5KB): to canon/sources/ with a synthesis signal
  for the worldbuild node to process into canon documents.

Tracks all mappings in canon/.manifest.json.
