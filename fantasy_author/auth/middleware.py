"""Auth middleware for the Universe Server MCP.

Provides request-level auth resolution that works with FastMCP's
tool execution model. Since FastMCP tools are plain functions (not
HTTP handlers), auth is resolved via a context pattern rather than
HTTP middleware.

For now, auth state is set at the module level per-request via
the transport layer. When FastMCP adds native auth hooks, this
module will adapt to use them.
