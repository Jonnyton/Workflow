# install-workflow-env.sh — atomic edit of /etc/workflow/env.
#
# Replaces every existing `sudo sed -i ... /etc/workflow/env && sudo
# chown root:workflow ... && sudo chmod 640 ...` chain (CI workflows +
# any future call site) with a single atomic write that cannot leave
# the file in a wrong-perm state.
#
# Background — `/etc/workflow/env` mode-flip class
# ------------------------------------------------
# `sed -i` writes a temp file then `rename(2)`s it over the target. The
# new inode is created with default ownership (root:root) and umask-
# derived mode (typically 0600). Any error or signal between the `sed`
# and the follow-up `chown + chmod` leaves the file unreadable by the
# `workflow` user → systemd unit's `ExecStartPre=test -r` fails →
# docker compose silently crash-loops → cloudflared never starts →
# public endpoint dark. Root cause of the 2026-04-21 P0 outage.
#
# `install -m 640 -o root -g workflow` writes the new file at the
# target path with the correct owner and perms in a single syscall
# sequence, leaving NO intermediate state with wrong perms. Closes
# RC-1 from `docs/audits/2026-04-25-etc-workflow-env-mode-flip.md`.
#
# Usage (from a CI workflow over SSH)
# -----------------------------------
#   # Set/replace a key — value comes from stdin (multi-line OK):
#   echo "ghcr.io/jonnyton/workflow-daemon:abc123" \
#     | ssh "$DROPLET" 'sudo bash -s -- set WORKFLOW_IMAGE' \
#     < deploy/install-workflow-env.sh
#
#   # Delete one or more keys (no stdin needed):
#   ssh "$DROPLET" 'sudo bash -s -- delete WORKFLOW_WIKI_PATH' \
#     < deploy/install-workflow-env.sh
#
# Idempotency
# -----------
# `set` is idempotent — running twice with the same value is a no-op
# from the file's perspective (same content, same mode, same owner).
# `delete` is idempotent — deleting an already-absent key is a no-op.
#
# Required privilege
# ------------------
# Must run as root (`sudo bash -s --` over SSH). The script `exec`s
# `install(1)` which needs root to chown to root:workflow.
#
# Exit codes
# ----------
#   0  success — file rewritten with new content (or no-op for absent
#      delete targets), owner=root:workflow, mode=640, readable by the
#      workflow user (post-write assert passes).
#   1  bad invocation (unknown subcommand, missing args, missing key
#      name, value containing forbidden chars).
#   2  /etc/workflow/env missing — bootstrap should have created it.
#   3  install(1) failed.
#   4  post-write readability assert failed (workflow user cannot read).
