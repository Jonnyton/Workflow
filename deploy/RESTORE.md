# Workflow — state restore runbook

Self-host migration Row J per
`docs/exec-plans/active/2026-04-20-selfhost-uptime-migration.md`.

Backups are nightly snapshots of the `workflow-data` named Docker
volume, uploaded to Hetzner Storage Box. This runbook restores from
a backup onto a fresh (or existing) Hetzner box.

**When to use:**
- Full data loss (box destroyed, disk corrupted, state file deleted).
- Rollback after a bad migration / upgrade.
- Restore-test drill (run quarterly per SUCCESSION.md §8 launch-readiness).

**Estimated time:** 5-15 min depending on archive size.

---

## Preconditions

- A running (or freshly provisioned per HETZNER-DEPLOY.md) Hetzner
  box with Docker + the workflow-daemon unit installed but STOPPED.
- `/etc/workflow/env` populated with `STORAGEBOX_HOST` /
  `STORAGEBOX_USER` / `STORAGEBOX_PASS` (same creds the backup job uses).
- `rclone` installed (bootstrap handles this).

## Step 1 — Stop the daemon (~10s)

```bash
sudo systemctl stop workflow-daemon
# Watchdog stays running — harmless (it'll see the outage + log reds,
# but won't restart because we're about to replace state).
```

## Step 2 — List available backups (~5s)

```bash
# Source the env so rclone picks up the config.
set -a; . /etc/workflow/env; set +a

# Write the ephemeral rclone config (same shape as backup.sh).
mkdir -p ~/.config/rclone
cat > ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf <<EOF
[storagebox]
type = sftp
host = ${STORAGEBOX_HOST}
user = ${STORAGEBOX_USER}
pass = $(rclone obscure "${STORAGEBOX_PASS}")
port = 22
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf

# List. Most recent first.
rclone lsl storagebox:workflow-backups/ | sort -k2,3 -r | head -20
```

Expect tarballs named `workflow-data-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ.tar.zst`.
Pick the one you want (usually the most recent).

## Step 3 — Pull it down (~1-5 min depending on size)

```bash
BACKUP="workflow-data-2026-04-21T03-00-00Z.tar.zst"  # replace
rclone copy "storagebox:workflow-backups/${BACKUP}" /tmp/
ls -lh "/tmp/${BACKUP}"
```

## Step 4 — Wipe current volume (DESTRUCTIVE — only after step 1)

```bash
# Defensive: daemon must be stopped. Verify.
sudo systemctl is-active workflow-daemon
# Expected: inactive (or failed — OK, just not running).

# Remove the volume. Docker refuses if any container mounts it —
# that's why we stopped the daemon first.
sudo docker volume rm workflow-data

# Re-create the named volume (empty) so the restore has a target.
sudo docker volume create workflow-data
```

## Step 5 — Extract into the new volume (~30s-2min)

```bash
VOLUME_DIR="$(sudo docker volume inspect --format '{{ .Mountpoint }}' workflow-data)"
echo "restoring into ${VOLUME_DIR}"

# Tar contains `_data/...` entries (preserves the original parent
# dirname). Extract into the volume's parent so paths line up.
sudo tar --zstd -xf "/tmp/${BACKUP}" -C "$(dirname "${VOLUME_DIR}")"

# Sanity: verify some expected files exist.
sudo ls -la "${VOLUME_DIR}" | head
```

Expect to see the daemon's state files: `.auth.db`, `.node_eval.db`,
`.workflow.db`, per-universe subdirs, etc. Older backups may still contain
`.author_server.db`; current code renames it to `.workflow.db` on first boot.

## Step 6 — Start the daemon + verify (~30s)

```bash
sudo systemctl start workflow-daemon
sudo systemctl status workflow-daemon
# Watch for: daemon-1 | Starting Workflow Server on 0.0.0.0:8001

# Verify via canary.
python3 /opt/workflow/scripts/mcp_public_canary.py \
    --url https://tinyassets.io/mcp --verbose
```

Exit 0 + `[canary] OK` = restore successful.

## Step 7 — Clean up (~5s)

```bash
rm -f "/tmp/${BACKUP}"
rm -f ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
```

## Recovery-test drill (quarterly)

Per SUCCESSION.md §8 launch-readiness: verify the restore path works
before an incident forces it.

1. Provision a second Hetzner CX22 as a staging box (not the prod box).
2. Run `hetzner-bootstrap.sh` on it.
3. Copy `/etc/workflow/env` from prod (READ-ONLY: copy then edit;
   consider making the staging box point at a separate testnet Supabase).
4. Run steps 2-6 above.
5. Verify canary green.
6. **Destroy** the staging box when done (€5.83/mo is real money).

Log the drill date + result in SUCCESSION.md acceptance criteria.

## Common failure modes

- **Backup tarball corrupted.** `tar --zstd -t` to list contents before
  extracting; if `tar: Error is not recoverable`, the archive is bad.
  Try a different backup (older). If multiple backups are bad, the
  backup.sh pipeline itself is broken — investigate before relying on
  any untested backup.
- **rclone auth failure.** `rclone lsl storagebox:` hangs or returns
  `Permission denied`. Re-check `STORAGEBOX_USER` + `STORAGEBOX_PASS` in
  `/etc/workflow/env`. Hetzner Storage Box SSH creds can be rotated at
  the Hetzner console if compromised.
- **Volume already in use.** `docker volume rm workflow-data` refuses
  because a container mounts it. Run `sudo docker ps -a | grep
  workflow-data` to find the container, stop + remove it, retry.
- **Disk full.** `/tmp` needs ~2x archive size free. If low, extract to
  `/var/lib/docker/volumes/workflow-data/_data` directly and skip `/tmp`:
  `sudo tar --zstd -xf - -C "$(dirname "${VOLUME_DIR}")" < <(rclone cat storagebox:workflow-backups/${BACKUP})`.
- **Post-restore canary red but daemon up.** State from an incompatible
  schema version. Check daemon logs for migration errors; may need to
  restore an older backup that matches the current daemon version OR
  re-deploy a matching daemon image (`WORKFLOW_IMAGE` in `/etc/workflow/env`).

## What this runbook does NOT cover

- **Partial restore** (one universe's state, not whole-volume). Extract
  the tar to a scratch dir, copy the specific subdir into the live
  volume. No tooling for this yet; add if incidents surface.
- **Point-in-time recovery** (restore to a specific timestamp within a
  day). Backup is nightly snapshots only. Sub-day recovery needs WAL
  shipping or similar; not in current scope.
- **Cross-region migration** (move the daemon from Hetzner to another
  provider). Restore works identically anywhere Docker runs; the
  Cloudflare tunnel just needs to point at the new box's cloudflared
  instance.
