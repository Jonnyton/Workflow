# Status

Live steering only. **Budget 4 KB / 60 lines.** Concerns/Work = one line each; landed rows are deleted; Forever rule = 24/7 uptime with zero hosts online.

**Scope (2026-05-19 reframe):** STATUS.md is for project-folder-access AIs (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor sessions). Substantive work flows through the live MCP brain — wiki + dispatcher + auto-change loop. Use STATUS.md for cross-session coordination state that does not have a wiki home; check the live brain (PR-###, BUG-### in wiki) for active work.

## Concerns

- [filed:2026-04-17 verified:2026-04-28] Privacy mode: 2 of 3 host-Qs OBVIATED by community-build (per-conversation chatbot composes); Q6.3 STILL-PLATFORM (third-party providers in fallback chain — `workflow/providers/router.py`).
- [filed:2026-04-18 verified:2026-04-28] `add_canon_from_path` sensitivity: 3 host-Qs REFRAMED by commons-first audit F3 (self-auditing-tools structured caveats).
- [filed:2026-04-24] Task #9 host Qs: GROQ/GEMINI/XAI GH Actions secrets present + rotation e2e validated after deploy step ships.
- **[P1 filed:2026-04-30]** Castles II live run `28479d8ddfb44488` failed `provider_exhausted` at `candidate_discovery` (see BUG-038); blocks branch-run proof. Companion: BUG-039 (Echoes intake same root cause).
- [filed:2026-04-30 reframed:2026-05-19] Classic-game v0 desktop shortcut concern: now PR-131 in dispatcher queue (`bc6ed9df-e764-495a-b466-c5c86d7e0e2e`); user-canary packet `tiberian_sun_host_local_effect_packet_v1` built with correct idempotency_key + asset policy. First consumer of #914 external-write design.
- [filed:2026-06-10] Droplet `/opt/workflow` checkout is stale (c1380fa) + dirty (compose.yml, vector-entrypoint.sh local edits); systemd units run scripts from it. Needs deliberate sync strategy — NOT `git pull` (would drag local edits live).
- [filed:2026-05-19] Wiki has shifted toward multi-agent shared scratch space — 81% of post-2026-05-01 notes (495 of 614) are Codex/Cowork/Claude agent-coordination. Volume risks drowning out chatbot discovery/remix. Worth a host conversation on whether to split coordination off the knowledge wiki.
- [filed:2026-06-25] Live ui-test surfaced daemon `/data/runs`=0 bytes — run transcripts may not persist, so the ~40% 303–308s timeout-cluster failures leave no error trail. UNVERIFIED in code; check droplet run-transcript write path.

## Approved Specs

Full specs: `docs/vetted-specs.md` (H2 heading per spec). Dev reads there, never wiki. On land, delete row + H2 section together.

## Work

universe_server.py: 14012 → 1927 LOC live in main. PLAN.md restructured 30→11 modules (#915, 41569b5) — Brain Module + skills tie-in + plan_module_audit script LANDED 2026-05-19. External-write authority design locked + on main (#914, e2c20f4).

**Multi-provider note:** any provider runs `python scripts/claim_check.py --provider <yourname>` to discover what's safe to claim. AGENTS.md §"Parallel Dispatch" has the full ritual.

## Live brain notes (informational; not work rows)

Substantive work flowing through the live MCP brain — not duplicated here. **[Snapshot last swept 2026-05-19 — STALE; verify in the live brain (read_page) before relying.]**

- **PR-129** (filed 2026-05-19) — Goal-bound branch protocols / ordered branch family runbook with typed artifact handoffs. Real community-build case (chatbot already composed manually via wiki prose; needs first-class durability). Dispatcher `ec15c952-aefa-42ab-b50b-eee1524d3ef9` queued.
- **PR-131** (filed 2026-05-19) — Host-local Windows desktop effect adapter; closes BUG-043 generalized. First consumer of #914 external-write design. Dispatcher `bc6ed9df-e764-495a-b466-c5c86d7e0e2e` queued.
- **PR-130** (Markovic) — peer-reviewed simulation-biology publication strategy.
- **PR-139 / GH #1090** — souled-universe consolidation; all 10 slices merged + deployed 2026-05-28.
- **New universes in flight:** Meridian Ashes (fantasy prose-lab), Etsy Printify v2 (commerce via effect packets), Markovic (scientific publication).

## Next

1. **Live brain is primary** for substantive work flow — wiki + dispatcher + auto-change loop. STATUS.md is the project-folder-access coordination layer; check both.
2. **Cheat-loop CI retired per 2026-06-25 host directive** — `AUTO_FIX_DISABLED=true`; remove intake/writer/checker machinery while preserving get_status, deploy lanes, MCP canaries, and live brain/dispatcher surfaces.
3. **No-shims-ever rule active** + **platform responsibility model** + **public-surface probes after DNS/tunnel/Worker/connector changes** (canonical: https://tinyassets.io/mcp).
4. **Scoping rules apply to design questions themselves** (per `feedback_design_questions_apply_scoping_rules_first.md`) — if X composes from primitives or has open-ended variations, do NOT present "platform builds it" as an option when steering.
