# Status

Live steering only. **Budget 4 KB / 60 lines.** Concerns/Work = one line each; landed rows are deleted; Forever rule = 24/7 uptime with zero hosts online.

**Scope (2026-05-19 reframe):** STATUS.md is for project-folder-access AIs (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor sessions). Substantive work flows through the live MCP brain — wiki + dispatcher + auto-change loop. Use STATUS.md for cross-session coordination state that does not have a wiki home; check the live brain (PR-###, BUG-### in wiki) for active work.

## Concerns

- [filed:2026-04-17 verified:2026-04-28] Privacy mode: 2 of 3 host-Qs OBVIATED by community-build (per-conversation chatbot composes); Q6.3 STILL-PLATFORM (third-party providers in fallback chain — `tinyassets/providers/router.py`).
- [filed:2026-04-18 verified:2026-04-28] `add_canon_from_path` sensitivity: 3 host-Qs REFRAMED by commons-first audit F3 (self-auditing-tools structured caveats).
- [filed:2026-04-24] Task #9 host Qs: GROQ/GEMINI/XAI GH Actions secrets present + rotation e2e validated after deploy step ships.
- **[P1 filed:2026-04-30]** Castles II live run `28479d8ddfb44488` failed `provider_exhausted` at `candidate_discovery` (see BUG-038); blocks branch-run proof. Companion: BUG-039 (Echoes intake same root cause).
- [filed:2026-05-19] Wiki has shifted toward multi-agent shared scratch space — 81% of post-2026-05-01 notes (495 of 614) are Codex/Cowork/Claude agent-coordination. Volume risks drowning out chatbot discovery/remix. Worth a host conversation on whether to split coordination off the knowledge wiki.
- [filed:2026-06-30] Universe ACL completeness follow-ups from Codex review of founder-identity slice 3 (`docs/audits/2026-06-30-founder-identity-slice3-codex-acl-review.md`): F1 wiki scaffold-before-auth; F2 private-universe wiki READS ungated (needs host design steer — must not break public discovery); F3 attach/cancel/receipt run mutations bypass universe ACL; F5 engine_helpers UNIVERSE_SERVER_USER fallback + resume_run raw-actor equality. Slice-3 write gates themselves verified correct.
- [filed:2026-06-30 verified:2026-06-30] WorkOS production auth: enforcement + discovery FIXED on `claude/founder-identity-allslices` (resolve-always write gate — anon read-only, founder+grant for write/costly; WorkOS-aware PRM + mounted well-known routes). Residual: (a) per-universe `admin` scope for founders deliberately deferred (needs admin-action ACL coverage — ties to slice-3 F3); (b) live WorkOS rollout still needs canary + chatbot ui-test.

## Approved Specs

Full specs: `docs/vetted-specs.md` (H2 heading per spec). Dev reads there, never wiki. On land, delete row + H2 section together.

## Live brain notes

Substantive work flows through the live MCP brain (wiki `PR-###`/`BUG-###` + dispatcher + auto-change loop), not duplicated here. Full enumeration + theme distribution: `.claude/agent-memory/navigator/wiki_sweep_cursor.md` (refresh before relying). In flight: PR-129 (branch protocols), PR-131 (Windows effect adapter), PR-139 (souled-universe, deployed); universes Meridian Ashes / Etsy Printify v2 / Markovic.

## Next

1. **Live brain is primary** for substantive work flow — wiki + dispatcher + auto-change loop. STATUS.md is the project-folder-access coordination layer; check both.
2. **Cheat-loop CI retired per 2026-06-25 host directive** — `AUTO_FIX_DISABLED=true`; remove intake/writer/checker machinery while preserving get_status, deploy lanes, MCP canaries, and live brain/dispatcher surfaces.
3. **No-shims-ever rule active** + **platform responsibility model** + **public-surface probes after DNS/tunnel/Worker/connector changes** (canonical: https://tinyassets.io/mcp).
4. **Scoping rules apply to design questions themselves** (per `feedback_design_questions_apply_scoping_rules_first.md`) — if X composes from primitives or has open-ended variations, do NOT present "platform builds it" as an option when steering.
