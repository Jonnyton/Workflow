"""Research probe domain graph topology.

Defines a flat 2-phase loop with revision gates:
  gather → analyze → synthesize → review → (if needs_revision → gather, else → END)

This is deliberately different from Workflow's 4-level hierarchy,
proving that the workflow engine can accommodate multiple graph topologies.
