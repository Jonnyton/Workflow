"""Workflow domain-specific evaluation criteria.

Defines what a "good" scene looks like from the Workflow perspective.
These criteria are used during commit/evaluation phases to provide feedback
to the writer.

Criteria are organized into categories:
- Coherence: does the scene make logical sense?
- Consistency: does it match established facts and voice?
- Momentum: does it advance plot and character?
- Craft: does it meet minimum prose standards?
