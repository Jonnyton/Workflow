"""Fantasy-domain TaskProducers (Phase C.4).

Three producers wrap existing universe-cycle logic so the daemon can
iterate them uniformly. Registration happens in
``domains/fantasy_daemon/__init__.py`` at import time:

    SeedProducer           — origin="seed"
    FantasyAuthorialProducer — origin="fantasy_authorial"
    UserRequestProducer    — origin="user_request"

Registration order IS dispatch order (spec §1.2). Later producers
overwrite earlier ones on target_id collision.
