# Premise

Read or update the story premise (PROGRAM.md) that seeds the daemon's creative direction.

## Usage

- `/workflow-universe-server:premise` with no arguments: call `universe`
  with `action="read_premise"` and display the current premise.
- `/workflow-universe-server:premise <text>`: call `universe` with
  `action="set_premise"` and the provided text. Warn the user this
  overwrites the existing premise. Offer to show the current premise first.

## Notes

The daemon reads the premise once at startup. Changing it mid-run will take effect on the next daemon restart or universe switch.
