"""BranchTaskProducer protocol + active registry (Phase F).

Distinct from ``workflow/producers/__init__.py``'s in-universe
``TaskProducer``:

- ``TaskProducer.produce`` → ``list[WorkTarget]`` (content, in-universe,
  runs inside review gates).
- ``BranchTaskProducer.produce`` → ``list[BranchTask]`` (execution
  intents, cross-universe, runs at dispatcher boundaries).

Two registries, two protocols, zero overlap. Preflight §4.3 invariant 2
(R2 keystone). Invariant 3 clarifies the call-site split.

Synchronous for v1; memo §3.2 allows a future async variant when a
producer does I/O (HTTP, remote git fetch). Current goal_pool reads
local files + optional ``git fetch`` — sync is fine.
