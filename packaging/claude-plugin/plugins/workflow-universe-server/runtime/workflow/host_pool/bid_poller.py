"""Bid-polling loop — surface pending requests to tray UI.

Wave 1 discipline per dispatch 2026-04-20: **NOT auto-claim.** Tray
decides. This loop only reads pending ``requests`` rows matching the
host's capability and forwards them to a caller callback.

Auto-claim cascade (per memory ``project_daemon_default_behavior``)
ships in a later iteration gated on host-mode settings. Wave 1 keeps
the surface minimal: read, notify.

Cadence: 60s default. Lower than heartbeat because discovery latency
matters more than heartbeat cadence for UX. Rate-limit-free at
expected tier-1 scale (< 100 requests / host / day first-draft).
