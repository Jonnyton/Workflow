"""Host-pool registration — tray startup flow.

Wave 1 per Track D: on tray startup, create a ``host_pool`` row with
the daemon's declared capabilities + visibility. Returns the new
``host_id`` which the caller holds for the session (heartbeat +
deregistration target).

Idempotent. If a row already exists for (owner_user_id, capability_id)
— best-effort lookup first, else insert. Row version column handles
concurrent-startup conflicts in a race-aware but lenient way (not
load-bearing for Wave 1).
