"""Quality leaderboard + parent-selection — PR-123 substrate (M2).

Surfaces, for any Goal that has competing Branch entries:

- ``quality_leaderboard(goal_id)`` — ranked list of Branches bound to
  the Goal, with the per-entry signal summary that produced the score.
- ``recommended_parent_for_fork(goal_id)`` — the top entry plus a
  human-readable rationale string, intended as a thin handle for the
  community designer asking "what should I fork from?".

Design source: wiki page
``pages/patch-requests/pr-123-goal-archive-with-parent-selection-...``
on the live MCP brain. The PLAN Goals & Gates module names this
surface as ``archive_consultation parent-rank scoring formula`` and
flags it as **open evolution** — a follow-on may turn the scoring
formula into an evolvable Workflow node so the community can iterate
on weights through autoresearch rather than asking the platform to
ship "the right" constants.

This slice is **best-effort v1**: ranking is signal-driven, not
ground-truth-driven. The formula constants are surfaced in every
response under ``formula`` so reviewers can audit and tune them
without re-reading source.

Goal-generic by design — same primitive works for patch-loops AND
fantasy-writing AND recipe-trackers AND any community. No
Loop-2-specific assumptions.

Signals (all read from existing storage; no new tables in this slice):

- ``completed_run_count`` — runs with ``status='completed'``.
- ``failed_run_count`` — runs with ``status='failed'`` (penalty).
- ``total_run_count`` — full count regardless of status.
- ``last_successful_run_at`` — max ``finished_at`` of completed runs.
- ``recency_decay`` — ``exp(-age_days/30)`` against the wall clock;
  0 when the branch never produced a successful run.
- ``judgment_count`` — rows in ``run_judgments`` joined via ``runs``.
- ``judgment_score_avg`` — mean of numeric scores parsed from
  judgment tags like ``quality:8.2``, ``novelty:7``, ``risk:3``.
  None when no numeric tags exist (the signal contributes 0 to the
  score in that case rather than NaN-propagating).
- ``fork_count`` — branches whose ``parent_def_id`` or ``fork_from``
  references this branch. Community votes with their forks.
- ``gate_rung_top`` — the lexicographically-greatest active
  ``rung_key`` from ``gate_claims`` for this (branch, goal).
- ``safe_to_publish`` — best-effort read of
  ``branch.stats.next_action_packet.safe_to_publish``. The packet
  shape isn't on-disk-stable yet; if absent, the signal contributes 0.

Score formula (weights surfaced in the response so they are auditable):

  score = 3.0 * normalized_judgment_score
        + 1.5 * log1p(completed_run_count)
        + 2.0 * log1p(fork_count)
        + 2.0 * recency_decay
        + 1.0 * has_gate_rung
        + 1.5 * safe_to_publish
        - 1.0 * log1p(failed_run_count)

``normalized_judgment_score`` is ``judgment_score_avg / 10.0`` (DGM
scores are on a 0-10 scale) clamped to [0, 1] so the term is bounded.
log1p bounds the impact of high-volume entries; recency / gate /
safe_to_publish are already [0, 1].

Tie-breaks: higher ``last_successful_run_at`` wins; then higher
``created_at`` (newer entry); then ``branch_def_id`` for stability.
