"""Attribution share calculation — depth-decay credit distribution.

Given a provenance DAG (list of AttributionEdges) rooted at an artifact,
compute normalized credit shares for each artifact in the lineage, then
optionally aggregate by actor using AttributionCredit records.

Decay rule: each generation upstream from the leaf gets half the weight
of the next-newer generation. Leaf = generation 0 (the current artifact).
An author who contributed at generation depth d gets weight 2^(-d).
Authors at the same generation split that generation's weight equally.
Shares are normalized so the total sums to 1.0.
