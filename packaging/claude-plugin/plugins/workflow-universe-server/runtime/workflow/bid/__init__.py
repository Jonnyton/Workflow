"""Per-node paid-market bid mechanics.

Bid surface consists of:
- ``node_bid``: NodeBid dataclass + I/O + claim semantics.
- ``execution_log``: per-universe daemon-local activity log (mutable).
- ``settlements``: cross-host immutable settlement ledger (write-once).

First canonical Module Layout commitment per `PLAN.md` §Module Layout.
Promoted end-state 2026-04-19 from the four flat top-level modules
(``workflow/node_bid.py`` + ``workflow/bid_execution_log.py`` +
``workflow/bid_ledger.py`` deprecation shim + ``workflow/settlements.py``)
into this single package.

Per the host's foundation-end-state rule (``CLAUDE_LEAD_OPS.md``
§Foundation End-State): no compat shims at the old top-level paths.
Any remaining external callers must migrate to ``workflow.bid.*``.
