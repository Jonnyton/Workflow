"""Guarded canon-directory I/O chokepoint.

Every canon read, write, or enumeration must flow through this module so
containment is enforced in exactly one place. The containment primitive is
:func:`workflow.ingestion.canon_names.resolve_within_canon`, which calls
``.resolve()`` (following symlinks and collapsing ``..``) and rejects any
path that does not land under the resolved ``canon_dir``.

Why a chokepoint instead of scattered checks: every caller that does
``for f in canon_dir.iterdir(): f.read_text()`` or ``canon_dir / name`` and
then opens it is a place a symlinked ``.md`` (or a symlinked subdir under a
recursive walk, or an LLM-supplied ``../`` filename) can escape the canon
sandbox before any check runs. Routing all of them through these helpers
means a new caller cannot reintroduce the traversal class without going out
of its way.

Legitimate subdirectories (e.g. ``canon/sources/foo.txt``) stay allowed
because they still resolve under ``canon_root``; only escapes are rejected.

This module imports only :mod:`workflow.ingestion.canon_names` and the stdlib
so it carries zero internal-workflow import weight and cannot create circular
dependencies.

    Enumeration replaces the unguarded ``for f in canon_dir.iterdir()`` /
    ``canon_dir.glob(...)`` / ``canon_dir.rglob(...)`` pattern. Each entry is
    resolved under ``canon_dir`` *before* any stat or read; an entry that
    escapes (symlink pointing outside, or a ``..`` component surfaced by a
    recursive walk) is skipped with a warning rather than raising, so a single
    poisoned entry cannot abort a whole enumeration pass.

    Parameters
    ----------
    canon_dir:
        The universe ``canon/`` directory. Missing directories yield nothing.
    suffix:
        Optional suffix filter, case-insensitive, e.g. ``".md"`` or
        ``(".md", ".txt", ".markdown")``. ``None`` yields every contained file.
    recursive:
        When ``True`` walk subdirectories (replaces ``rglob``). Subdirs that
        are legitimate (resolve under canon_root) are descended; symlinked
        subdirs that escape are skipped.
    include_hidden:
        When ``False`` skip dotfiles (names beginning with ``.``) — markers
        and manifests stay out of content enumeration.
    kind:
        Error-message label forwarded to the containment check (debugging
        only; escapers are logged, not raised, during enumeration).

    Only paths that are (a) contained, (b) regular files (``.is_file()``
    checked on the *resolved* path so a symlink to a dir/device is excluded),
    and (c) suffix-matching are yielded. Results are sorted for determinism.
