"""Soul-scoped effect-authority resolution for external-write effectors.

Gap 1 of the souled-universe self-maintenance model (design note
``docs/design-notes/2026-05-28-souled-universe-effect-authority.md``). The
running universe's soul is the SOURCE of effect-authority: it declares which
real-world hands (``<sink>:<destination>`` grants) the universe's founder
authorizes. The env capability map (``WORKFLOW_GITHUB_PR_CAPABILITIES``)
carries the *secret/token*; the soul carries the *authority decision*.

Transitional contract (this scaffold):

- declared + match    -> ``AUTHORIZED``  (proceed to capability/consent gates)
- declared + no match -> ``DENIED``      (fail closed; effector returns dry-run)
- nothing declared    -> ``UNDECLARED``  (legacy fall-through to env + consent)

The cutover (post-review, after Tiny's soul declares its grants) removes the
``UNDECLARED`` fall-through so a soul grant becomes strictly required. Until
then, ``UNDECLARED`` preserves the pre-existing env-capability + consent
behavior so no live universe breaks. This module is effect-sink-agnostic;
any effector resolves authority the same way.
