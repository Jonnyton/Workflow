"""Blank OKF soul-bundle seeder for new universes.

Implements the ``universe-creation`` creation contract (D4/D5): creation seeds
one linked OKF concept-document bundle rooted at ``soul.md``. Every file is an
OKF concept document (YAML frontmatter with a non-empty ``type``); the bundle
tracks the *latest-main* OKF spec on GitHub rather than a pinned copy, so it
never goes stale.

Files seeded (13):

    index.md  log.md  soul.md  soul.edit.md  identity.md  founder.md
    orgchart.md  projects.md  goals.md  body.md  origin.md
    soul_versions/index.md  soul_versions/0001.md

Creation does NOT create ``self/``, ``soul/``, ``notes.json``, or
``activity.log``. A blank universe is unnamed: its self-name is learned later
through ``identity.md`` and the linked soul files.

The seeded ``soul.md`` stays parseable by :mod:`tinyassets.universe_soul` (a
blank universe simply reads back as an empty :class:`UniverseSoul`), so persona
resolution and status reads are unaffected.

## Governed files

A soul edit MAY update only these explicitly changed files:

{governed}

`orgchart.md`, `projects.md`, and `goals.md` are learned/runtime files and are
NOT governed by this policy.

## Rules

- A soul edit is a learning event: caller input is proposed learning with
  source and context, never a blind overwrite of the soul.
- Only the explicitly changed governed files above are updated.
- Every accepted soul edit appends an entry to [log](log.md).
- Every accepted soul edit writes a new snapshot under
  [soul_versions](soul_versions/index.md).
- The MCP execution path for `universe action=soul.edit` reads and follows this
  file; the authority lives here, not in a hardcoded string.
