- Browser launch asset: `assets/scorched-tanks-v1.90-autostart-30582ca3.adf` (`assets/scorched-tanks-v1.90-autostart.adf` is retained as a corrected compatibility alias).
- Launch patch: `S/Startup-Sequence` changes from `LoadWB\nendcli\n` to `Stack 65536\ncd :\nScorched_TanksV1.90\nendcli\n`; game executable and data assets are unchanged. The ADF was regenerated with `xdftool write` so the Startup-Sequence file header reports the full 44-byte script.

- Reference package: Scorched Tanks v1.85 on Aminet at `https://aminet.net/package/game/shoot/Scorch185`.
- Browser runtime: vAmigaWeb at `https://github.com/vAmigaWeb/vAmigaWeb` and `https://vamigaweb.github.io/`.
- Optional hosted firmware path: `licensed/kickstart-a500-1.3.rom`, intentionally absent from the repository. A deployment may provision this only under a rights-cleared Kickstart license.

This page launches the autostart ADF in vAmigaWeb from a browser-only Workflow result. The parent page fetches the same-site ADF and injects the bytes into the iframe so static hosts do not need cross-origin ADF headers. It first checks for a rights-cleared hosted A500 Kickstart 1.3 ROM, then falls back to the open AROS ROM path, then accepts a user-owned Kickstart ROM through a local file picker without uploading the ROM.

Compatibility finding, verified 2026-05-01: Scorched Tanks v1.90 has a valid Startup-Sequence header and reaches the AROS shell in vAmigaWeb. The launcher can mount the injected ADF and unlock audio, but the AROS firmware path still does not reach playable Scorched Tanks. Exact-game acceptance remains `NEEDS_RIGHTS_CLEARED_FIRMWARE` until a deployment supplies a rights-cleared Kickstart-compatible ROM path and verifies live gameplay with input, sound, and a tank hit captured.

No proprietary Kickstart ROM is bundled. The browser-native artillery port is kept only as a labeled fallback and must not be reported by Workflow as the exact original game. Live fallback proof, 2026-05-01: on `https://tinyassets.io/play/scorched-tanks/index.html`, a real browser canvas click fired a Big Shot, audio state was `running`, and the shot hit Kade for 52.6 damage (`output/scorched-compat-hit-tank-audio-live.png`, `output/scorched-compat-hit-tank-audio-live.json`).
