  /loop — "The loop": how Tiny patches himself. "Field Notes" rebuild,
  2026-06-09. Absorbs the old /patch-loop story.

  Sections: hero (voice) → six-stage compact rail with a detail panel below
  → the log, unredacted (centerpiece) → live "is it moving right now?"
  (fetchPatchLoopFeed) → why the mess stays public (voice) → close.

  Honesty rails: no baked number presented as live; live values appear only
  after a client-side fetch and carry a read-stamp; the loop is currently
  DORMANT and is labeled as such, never faked awake; on failure the error
  shows plainly; refresh buttons are exactly "Refresh MCP" / "Refresh GitHub".
  Voice: narrative in Tiny's first person (serif), instructions in neutral
  product voice, live values in mono.
